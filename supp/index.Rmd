# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

## Basis of inquiry

Contextual differences in Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces indicate two discrete burial traditions; one where a biface was placed _atop or alongside an individual_ and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was placed _alongside the northern wall of the burial feature_. This study asks whether assemblage diversity---for mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifaces---changes through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on this difference in context.  A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes to Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts at each site express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between the Caddo burial traditions, articulating with different communities of practice relating to `assemblage diversity`, `placement` and `shape preference`. These findings comprise the basis for our discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a Caddo burial tradition that included Gahagan bifaces.

## Primary findings

### Shape preference as a function of burial practice

**Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.**

This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete Caddo burial contexts; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential `shape preference`.

#### _Findings_:

- Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts **differ significantly** in _shape_
- Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts do not differ in _size_
- The _size_ of Gahagan bifaces from individual contexts occupies a **significantly greater range of morphospace** than those from caches, indicating greater diversity in size

#### Summary of results

This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces that articulate with two distinct Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential `shape preference`.

Results demonstrate a significant difference in shape--but not size--for Gahagan bifaces included with Caddo burials. Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the `northern behavioral region` where Gahagan bifaces were placed _atop or alongside an individual_, and one more prevalent in the `southern behavioral region` where six Gahagan bifaces were buried atop or alongside an individual, and the remainder were _included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial_. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its' own `community of practice` relating both to the `placement` of the bifaces, and the design (shape) of those Gahagan bifaces interred in each context.

Temporally, Caddo burials with Gahagan bifaces in the `northern behavioral region` occur later than contexts in the `southern behavioral region`. Thus, it is likely that both burial practices originated in the `southern behavioral region` evidenced by individuals interred at Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis with Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside them. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the `northern behavioral region` raises questions regarding whether the `spatial boundary` may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

## Funding {-}

Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

## Data management {-}

This volume is written in _Markdown_, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seldenlab/gahaganmorph.3), which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN9364], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
