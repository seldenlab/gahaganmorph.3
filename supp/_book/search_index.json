Selden, Jr.1 and John E. Dockall2 2021-10-07 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry Gahagan bifaces represent one of three categories of Caddo material culture that express a significant differences in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, in review). Gahagan biface morphology was also found to differ significantly between the ancestral Caddo area and central Texas regions (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). That Gahagan bifaces differ across two spatial boundaries was noteworthy, particularly since they are assumed to have been manufactured in central Texas, arriving in the ancestral Caddo area as products of trade or exchange (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Shafer 1973, 1974, 2006). Gahagan bifaces express significant morphological differences when recovered from the areas of the northern and southern behavioral regions, which suggested that the temporal range of the shape boundary might extend to the Formative/Early Caddo period (CE 800 - 1250); a notion that was supported by previous analyses of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019), and later confirmed in a more comprehensive analysis of Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2021). This effort is the first to shift the analytical foci of this research program from one of regional trends to one of local Caddo burial contexts. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered with an individual denoted by black circles. Additional information for each bifaces, including the option to download 2D images of these bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Temporal change in Caddo preference Hypothesis 1: Gahagan bifaces selected for inclusion in Caddo burials differ in morphology through time. Hypothesis 1 is tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts from the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing temporal positions. The information gathered from the analysis provides valuable insights with regard to design intent and aesthetic preference that articulate with Gahagan bifaces at different temporal intervals. 0.2.1.1 Hypothesis 1a: Temporal change in Caddo preference at Mounds Plantation In assessing a temporal change in preference between populations of bifaces from Mounds Plantation, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1 in Mound 5, cutting downward from the mounds surface. The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that the burial occurred after those burials associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1a.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.1: Stratigraphic position of Burial Pits 1 and 2 at the Mounds Plantation site; adapted from Webb (1975:Figure 7). Burial Pit 2 is the only burial found to be intrusive from the mound surface. 0.2.1.1.1 Hypothesis 1a Findings: 0.2.1.2 Hypothesis 1b: Temporal change in Caddo preference at George C. Davis To assess the temporal change in preference between populations of bifaces from George C. Davis, those recovered from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119. The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred after those associated with Feature 134. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1b.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.2: Stratigraphic position of Features 119 and 134 at the George C. Davis site; adapted from Story (1997:Figure 13). 0.2.1.2.1 Hypothesis 1b Findings: 0.2.2 General morphological trajectory of Gahagan bifaces Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache offering differ in morphology from those placed with an individual. Hypothesis 2 is tested using a sample of Gahagan bifaces interred as part of a Caddo group offering (henceforth called a cache) or with a Caddo individual. Findings provide useful insights with regard to macro trends associated with the use-life of Gahagan bifaces, which may have ranged from a cache offering (where design intent is assumed) to an individual offering (where minor modification(s) or retouch may be present). 0.2.2.1 Hypothesis 2 Findings: 0.3 Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, the Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions and access needed to generate the 3D scans of the Gahagan bifaces. Thanks to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments on the analyses of Gahagan biface shape. RZS extend his gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms on an earlier draft of LM3d1, as well as the landmarking protocol used in this study (LM3d2), to Martin Hinz for fielding questions related to the oxcAAR package, to Derek Hamilton for his guidance with the chronological models, and to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Lauren Butaric, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. 0.4 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. 0.5 Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).
