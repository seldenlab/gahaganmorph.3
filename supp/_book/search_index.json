Selden, Jr.1, John E. Dockall2, and David L. Carlson3 2022-05-22 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). Figure 0.1: Location of sites with mortuary assemblages included in the study and geographic extent of the southern Caddo area outlined/in white. 0.1 Basis of inquiry Exchange networks and interaction spheres functioned to establish, maintain, and formalize regional traditions, boundaries, and intergroup relationships. Large formal bifaces and associated diagnostics included as mortuary offerings provide evidence of material culture shifts, conveying the spatial and temporal dynamics of local and regional burial traditions. Among the constituent groups associated with the Caddo Confederacy in the American Southeast, contextual differences in burial practices associated with Gahagan bifaces are indicative of two discrete burial traditions; one where a Gahagan biface was placed atop or alongside an individual, and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was included along the northern wall of the burial feature. This study asks whether mortuary assemblage diversity increases through time, whether Gahagan biface morphology differs by burial tradition, and whether the morphology of Gahagan bifaces associated with each burial tradition changed through time. A seriation of mortuary contexts followed by an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights a significant increase in mortuary assemblage diversity and evenness through time, where assemblages of the earliest mortuary offerings express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface shape differs between the two Caddo burial traditions, indicating discrete communities of practice delimited by placement and morphology. Bifaces included as offerings with individuals differ through time from those placed in caches; initially in size, and subsequently in shape. Bifaces found in caches express morphological stability through time as the burial traditions mature, and Caddo mortuary offerings become both more diverse and evenly distributed among the diagnostic types. These findings provide the basis for a discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a unique Caddo burial practice that occurs during their transition from a more mobile horticulturist lifeway to one of emergentand increasingly sedentaryagriculturalists. Figure 0.2: Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered atop or alongside an individual denoted by black dot. For reference to scale, the Gahagan biface at bottom left (m3) measures just over 48cm. Additional information for each biface, including the option to download full-resolution 2D images of individual bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings Figure 0.3: Explanatory hypotheses include a, an increase in mortuary assemblage diversity as the Caddo became more sedentary during their shift from a horticulturalist lifeway to one of emergent agriculturalist; and b, an increase in morphological diversity through the technological life cycle. 0.2.1 ASSEMBLAGE DIVERSITY Hypothesis: Caddo mortuary assemblages associated with Gahagan bifaces increase in diversity subsequent to their initial use in mortuary offerings. This hypothesis is tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds site where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. Figure 0.4: Relative abundance of a, adults and juveniles (binned to include all non-adults); b, lithic and ceramic artifacts; and c, diagnostic artefact types recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts that included a Gahagan biface. Contexts ordered temporally from bottom to top based on results of seriation (see Chapter 2). The middle two contexts (16RR1-BP2 and 16CD12-BP5) are interchangeable. 0.2.1.1 Findings: Juveniles are not present in the three latest assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces Lithics comprise 75% or morein three cases, 100%of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include a significantly greater diversity of associated diagnostics Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include significantly greater evenness across the types Figure 0.5: Caddo burial assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces; 1, 16CD12-BP8; 2, 16CD12-BP2; 3, 41CE19-F119; 4, 16RR1-BP2; 5, 16CD12-BP5; 6, 16RR1-BP3; 7, 41CE19-F134; 8, 16CD12-BP1. The three sites in the lower part of the left quadrat exhibit lower diversity and evenness, and represent the three earliest contexts to include a Gahagan biface. Those sites in the upper right quadrat have higher diversity and evenness, and occur later than those in the lower left quadrat. 0.2.1.2 Summary of results The hypothesis was tested using counts of associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mound sites where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assessed whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. Results follow with an expected increase in assemblage diversity during the cultural and subsistence-based transition from mobile horticulture to emergentand more sedentaryagricultural communities. Results demonstrate that lithics comprise 75% or more, in three cases, 100%, of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered, as well as a significant increase in the diversity and evenness of diagnostic artefacts included in Caddo burial contexts with Gahagan bifaces. This general trend articulates with the development, maintenance, and evolution associated with a Caddo burial practice. These assemblages are dominated by lithic diagnostics, and ceramics are absent from three of the burial contexts. Further discussion related to those diagnostic types that do/do not transcend specific spatial and temporal boundaries are included in the manuscript. 0.2.2 OBJECT PLACEMENT Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as part of a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference. 0.2.2.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces differ significantly in shape between cache and individual contexts Gahagan bifaces do not differ in size between cache and individual contexts Gahagan bifaces from individual contexts exhibit significantly greater size diversity Figure 0.6: Comparison of Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of mean shapes, gray dots represent cache contexts, and black dots represent individual contexts. 0.2.2.2 Summary of results Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where all but six Gahagan bifaces were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating both to placement and the design (shape) of Gahagan bifaces interred in each context. 0.2.3 TEMPORAL TRAJECTORIES Hypothesis 1 (Morphology): Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through timeinitial vs. subsequent depositionas mortuary assemblage diversity increases. Hypothesis 2 (Morphological Diversity): Morphological diversity in Gahagan bifaces increases through the technological life cycle These hypotheses are tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased. The analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time: Initial Individual: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Initial Cache: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature Subsequent Individual: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Subsequent Cache: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature 0.2.3.1 Findings: Morphology: Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Subsequent Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Initial Individual contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Cache contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in size Morphological Diversity: Gahagan bifaces from subsequent contexts are not more diverse in shape than those from initial contexts Gahagan bifaces from initial contexts placed atop/alongside individuals exhibit significantly greater size diversity than those from initial cache contexts, as well as those from subsequent individual and cache contexts Figure 0.7: In the comparison of Gahagan bifaces from discrete burial contexts, gray dots represent the mean shape at the top of the column, and black dots represent the mean shape at right. All comparisons in the first column differ significantly in size, those in the second column differ significantly in shape, and those in the third column do not differ in shape or size. 0.2.3.2 Summary of results These hypotheses were tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual from the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential preference as Caddo mortuary assemblage diversity increased. Results demonstrate that in the earliest Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in size (are larger) when compared with those placed in caches found along the northern wall of the burial pit. In the later burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in shape when compared with those placed in caches found along the northern wall of the burial pit. Caches of Gahagan bifaces found along the northern wall of Caddo burial pits exhibit morphological stability through time in that they differ neither in shape nor size as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increases. The hypothesis that morphological diversity in Gahagan bifaces increases through the technological life cycle is rejected. Gahagan bifaces from initial contexts that were placed atop or alongside an individual expressed a greater diversity in size than all other categories. Thus, for the comparison of Gahagan biface morphological diversity through time among contexts, those found with individuals express stability in shape, but the inverse of the hypothesis in size (becoming less diverse in size through time), while those from cache contexts express morphological stability in both shape and size through time. The temporal attribute used for the GM analysis is comprised of the same initial and subsequent contexts used in the analysis of Caddo mortuary assemblage diversity. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioural region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

Data management The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/Y7B39. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).
