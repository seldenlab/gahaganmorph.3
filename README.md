**Mortuary assemblage diversity, Gahagan biface morphology, and the evolution of a Caddo burial tradition in the American Southeast**

_Abstract_

Exchange networks and interaction spheres functioned to establish, maintain, and formalize regional traditions, boundaries, and intergroup relationships. Large formal bifaces and associated diagnostics included as mortuary offerings provide evidence of material culture shifts, conveying the spatial and temporal dynamics of local and regional burial traditions. Among the constituent groups associated with the Caddo Confederacy in the American Southeast, contextual differences in burial practices associated with Gahagan bifaces are indicative of two discrete burial traditions; one where a Gahagan biface was placed atop or alongside an individual, and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was included along the northern wall of the burial feature. This study asks whether mortuary assemblage diversity increases through time, whether Gahagan biface morphology differs by burial tradition, and whether the morphology of Gahagan bifaces associated with each burial tradition changed through time. A seriation of mortuary contexts followed by an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights a significant increase in mortuary assemblage diversity and evenness through time, where assemblages of the earliest mortuary offerings express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface shape differs between the two Caddo burial traditions, indicating discrete communities of practice delimited by placement and morphology. Bifaces included as offerings with individuals differ through time from those placed in caches; initially in size, and subsequently in shape. Bifaces found in caches express morphological stability through time as the burial traditions mature, and Caddo mortuary offerings become both more diverse and evenly distributed among the diagnostic types. These findings provide the basis for a discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a unique Caddo burial practice that occurs during their transition from a more mobile horticulturist lifeway to one of emergent-and increasingly sedentary-agriculturalists.
