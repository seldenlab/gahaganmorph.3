# Modeling Geometry

Two Gahagan bifaces, both from the George C. Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum.

Modeling was completed in _Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2019.0.2 [Build Number: 78])_. Modeling occurred in advance of the `auto3dgm` alignment. Following alignment, these two specimens were landmarked following the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces.

In both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following with the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in [@RN11521].

The images that follow include a before and after modeling image of each biface, illustrating the area of the biface that was missing, and the subsequent model that was used in the geometric morphometric analysis. In the case of 4078-8, one semilandmark was included in the modeled area. No semilandmarks were placed in the modeled area of 4078-72.
