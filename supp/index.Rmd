# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

## Basis of inquiry

Gahagan bifaces represent one of three categories of Caddo material culture that express significant differences in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles [@RN11783;@RN11801;@RN11782;@RN11716;@RN8312] and Perdiz arrow points ([Selden and Dockall, in review](https://github.com/seldenlab/perdiz3/blob/main/ms/perdiz3/perdiz3.pdf)). Gahagan biface morphology was also found to differ significantly between the ancestral Caddo area and central Texas regions [@RN21001].

That Gahagan bifaces differ across two `spatial boundaries` was noteworthy, particularly since they are assumed to have been manufactured in central Texas, arriving in the ancestral Caddo area as products of trade or exchange [@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN3682;@RN20701;@RN4924]. Gahagan bifaces express significant morphological differences when recovered from the areas of the northern and southern `Caddo behavioral regions`, which suggested that the temporal range of the `shape boundary` might extend to the Formative/Early Caddo period (CE 800 - 1250); a notion that was supported by previous analyses of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles [@RN11801;@RN11782;@RN11716], and later confirmed in a more comprehensive analysis of Caddo bottles [@RN8312].

This effort is the first to shift the analytical foci of this research program from one of regional trends to one of local Caddo burial contexts.

## Primary findings

### Temporal change in Caddo preference

**Hypothesis 1: Gahagan bifaces selected for inclusion in Caddo burials differ in morphology through time.**

Hypothesis 1 is tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing temporal positions. There is an important cultural distinction between archaeological contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, in that all of the Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation were recovered _in association with an individual_ (Burials 1, 2, 5, and 8) [@RN8174], and all of the Gahagan bifaces from George C. Davis articulate with _caches included along the periphery of two group burials_ (Features 119 and 134) [@RN3682;@RN8186]. The information gathered from the analysis provides valuable insights with regard to `design intent` and `aesthetic preference` for Gahagan bifaces recovered from discrete temporal intervals.

#### _Hypothesis 1a: Temporal change in Caddo preference at Mounds Plantation_

In assessing a temporal change in preference between Gahagan bifaces from Mound 5 at the Mounds Plantation site, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial Pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1, cutting downward from the mound's surface [@RN8174]. The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that this burial occurred after those associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8 [@RN8174].

```{r h1a, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Stratigraphic position of Burial Pits 1 and 2 at the Mounds Plantation site; adapted from Webb (1975:Figure 7). Burial Pit 2 is the only burial found to be intrusive from the mound surface."}

```

##### _Hypothesis 1a Findings_:

#### _Hypothesis 1b: Temporal change in Caddo preference at George C. Davis_

To assess the temporal change in preference between caches of Gahagan bifaces recovered from Mound C at the George C. Davis site, those from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119 [@RN3682;@RN8186]. The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred subsequent to those associated with Feature 134 [@RN3682;@RN8186].

```{r h1b, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Stratigraphic position of Features 119 and 134 at the George C. Davis site; adapted from Story (1997:Figure 13)."}

```

##### _Hypothesis 1b Findings_:

### General morphological trajectory of Gahagan bifaces

**Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.**

Hypothesis 2 is tested using two broad categories of Gahagan bifaces; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Distinct burial practices may have resulted in discrete Gahagan biface morphologies constrained by local traditions, which differ between the `behavioral regions`.

## Funding

Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

## Data management

This volume is written in _Markdown_, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seldenlab/gahaganmorph.3), which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
