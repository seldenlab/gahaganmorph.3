  Gahagan bifaces differ in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles and Perdiz arrow points, and also between the Caddo and central Texas regions. This study asks whether Gahagan biface morphology differs between stratigraphically-defined---and chronologically discrete---burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on qualitative differences in Caddo burial practices. Results indicate a significant difference in size between burial contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, where the pattern is inverted. At both sites, biface shape remains consistent and does not differ among contexts, indicating an established `shape preference` in the northern and southern behavioral regions that may have shifted significantly in size due to cyclical differences in the variable social mechanisms associated with raw material procurement. Gahagan bifaces also differ in shape between Caddo burial contexts where a biface was placed _alongside an individual_ and those found as part of a cache placed _alongside the northern wall of the burial feature_. Each burial tradition articulates with a distinct `community of practice` relating to Gahagan biface `placement` and `design intent`.

# Introduction

Found to occur along the western margin of the American Southeast, Gahagan bifaces are among the most recognizable and well known components of Caddo material culture, and were regularly included with burial offerings during the Formative (CE 800-1000) and Early (CE 1000-1250) Caddo periods \citep{RN8186,RN8174,RN8176}. Recent efforts to characterize general trends associated with Gahagan biface morphology yielded support for a `spatial boundary` that divides the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions based upon morphological differences that occur in Caddo bottles, Gahagan bifaces, and Perdiz arrow points (Figure 1c) \citep{RN7925,RN8071,RN8361,RN8967,RN8154}. A second `shape boundary` has also been posited based upon differences in Gahagan biface morphology between the Caddo and central Texas regions \citep{RN8318}.

# Contexts of recovery

## Gahagan Mound
Gahagan bifaces were identified in 1911 in Deposits 1, 2, and 3 of Burial Pit 1 at the Gahagan Mound site in northwest Louisiana by \citet[Figures 18-19, 21]{RN7107}. A subsequent excavation at the Gahagan Mound site in 1936 identified two additional burial features containing Gahagan bifaces (Burial Pits 2 and 3) (Figure 2) \citep[Plate 27]{RN8176}, and the entirety of the site was destroyed by the meander of the Red River four to five years later \citep{RN10759}.

## Mounds Plantation

## George C. Davis

Thanks to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments on the analyses of Gahagan biface shape. 

RZS extends his gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms of the landmarking protocol used in this study ([`LM3d1`](https://github.com/aksel-blaise/gahaganmorph2/blob/master/analysis/landmarking-protocol.md)), as well as the landmarking protocol for Gahagan bifaces that will be used in the next iteration of these analytical efforts ([`LM3d2`](https://seldenlab.github.io/gahaganmorph.3/landmarking-protocol-3d2.html)); to Martin Hinz for fielding questions related to the `oxcAAR` package and Derek Hamilton for his guidance with the chronological models; and to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Lauren Butaric, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program.

# Funding {-}

Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University.

# Data management {-}

The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the [GitHub](https://github.com/seldenlab/gahaganmorph.3) repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework [DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/Y7B39](https://osf.io/y7b39/). The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components \citep{RN8312,RN8313,RN8299}, which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology \citep{RN8207,RN8965,RN8154,RN8318,RN9364}, and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results \citep{RN10760}. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress \citep{RN10761}.
