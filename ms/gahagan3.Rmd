  Contextual differences in Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces indicate two discrete burial traditions; one where a biface was placed _atop or alongside an individual_ and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was placed _alongside the northern wall of the burial feature_. This study asks whether assemblage diversity---for mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifaces---changes through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on this difference in context.  A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes to Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts at each site express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between the Caddo burial traditions, articulating with different communities of practice relating to `assemblage diversity`, `placement` and `shape preference`. These findings comprise the basis for our discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a Caddo burial tradition that included Gahagan bifaces.

>Studying the history of paper exposes a number of historical misconceptions, the most important of which is this technological fallacy: the idea that technology changes society. It is exactly the reverse. Society develops technology to address the chages that are taking place within it \citep[xiv]{RN10878}.

# Introduction

Found to occur along the western margin of the American Southeast, Gahagan bifaces are among the most recognizable and well known components of Caddo material culture, and were regularly included with burial offerings during the Formative (CE 800-1000) and Early (CE 1000-1250) Caddo periods \citep{RN7115,RN8189,RN5746,RN8186,RN8174,RN8176}. Recent efforts to characterize general trends associated with Gahagan biface morphology yielded support for a `spatial boundary` that divides the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions based upon morphological differences that occur in Caddo bottles, Gahagan bifaces, and Perdiz arrow points (**`Chapter X, Figure 1c`**) \citep{RN7925,RN8071,RN8361,RN8967,RN11064,RN8154}. A second `shape boundary` has also been posited based upon differences in Gahagan biface morphology between the Caddo and central Texas regions \citep{RN8318}.

# Contexts of recovery

All Gahagan bifaces used in the analysis were recovered from Caddo burial contexts excavated between 1912 and 1969. Stratigraphic contexts were used to delimit temporal contexts, although the temporal span between these events remains unclear. Additional contextual information was used to identify Gahagan bifaces that were placed _atop or alongside an individual_, or _in caches along the northern wall of the burial pit_.

## Mounds Plantation (16CD12)

There is a contextual difference between Gahagan bifaces from Mound 5 at the Mounds Plantation site, where those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8) might be contrasted with those from Burial Pit 2 which was excavated into the corner of Burial Pit 1, cutting downward from the mound's surface (see Figure 2:a\textsubscript{1}-l\textsubscript{1}) [@RN8174]. The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that this burial may have occurred subsequent to those associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8 [@RN8174].

## Gahagan Mound (16RR1)
Gahagan bifaces were identified in 1911 from Deposits 1, 2, and 3 of Burial Pit 1 at the Gahagan Mound site in northwest Louisiana by \citet[Figures 18-19, 21]{RN7115}. A subsequent excavation at the Gahagan Mound site in 1936 identified two additional burial features containing Gahagan bifaces (Burial Pits 2 and 3) (see Figure 2:a\textsubscript{2}-ee\textsubscript{2}) \citep[Plate 27]{RN8176}, and the entirety of the Gahagan Mound site was destroyed by the meander of the Red River between four and five years after the excavation of Burial Pits 2 and 3 \citep{RN10759}.

## George C. Davis (41CE19)

To assess the temporal change in preference between caches of Gahagan bifaces recovered from Mound C at the George C. Davis site, those from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119 (see Figure 2:a\textsubscript{3}-y\textsubscript{3}) [@RN5746;@RN8186]. The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred subsequent to those associated with Feature 134 [@RN5746;@RN8186].

## Assemblage diversity

## 3D geometric morphometrics

**Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.**

This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces from two discrete Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential design intent.

Data collection procedures are outlined in \cite{RN8154} and \cite{RN8318}. Characteristic points and tangents used in the landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of \cite{RN5700}, and the landmarking protocol is discussed in detail in the [supplementary materials](https://seldenlab.github.io/gahaganmorph.3/). 

Landmarks were aligned to a global coordinate system \citep{RN8102,RN8587,RN8384}, achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition \citep{RN8525}, performed in R 4.1.1 \citep{RN8584} using the `geomorph` package v4.0.1 \citep{RN8565,RN9565}. Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates coordinate data allowing for comparisons among objects \citep{RN5698,RN8525}. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space \citep{RN8511,RN8384}.

Principal components analysis \citep{RN8576,RN10875} was used to visualize shape variation among the bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of the landmarks or the reference 3D mesh \citep{RN8555,RN8553}. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs \citep{RN8579,RN8334}, which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present \citep{RN6995}. To assess whether shape differs by context, Procrustes ANOVAs \citep{RN7046} were run that enlist effect-sizes (z-scores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions \citep{RN8477}. Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between groups and compare the amount of shape variation (morphological disparity) across sites \citep{RN5694}, which is estimated as the Procrustes variance using residuals of linear model fit \citep{RN8565,RN9565}. A comparison of mean consensus configurations was used to characterize shape variation in Gahagan bifaces recovered from contexts where they were found atop or beside an individual or as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial pit.

Procrustes ANOVA results indicate a significant difference in Gahagan biface shape by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.21033; Pr(>F) = 1e-04) (Figure 4), and the test for Gahagan biface (centroid) size by context did not yield a significant result (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.01138; Pr(>F) = 0.3933). The test for morphological disparity by biface size also yielded a significant result, indicating that the size of bifaces interred atop or alongside an individual occupy a significantly greater range of morphospace than those interred as part of a cache.

```{r mshape.bpractice, out.width = "90%", fig.align="center", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The difference between Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts is characterized by a narrower base, and a reduction in the flexuous blade shape (recurve) for bifaces found atop or alongside Caddo individuals. In the comparison of mean shapes by context, caches are presented in gray, and individuals in black."}

# Discussion

Chronometric dates associated with contexts yielding Gahagan bifaces leave much to be desired, and it is not possible at this time to order the burial contexts sequentially using the available chronometric data.

## Gahagan biface morphology differs by burial context

The hypothesis that _Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual_ was tested using Gahagan bifaces that articulate with two distinct Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential design intent.

Results highlight a significant difference in shape--but not size--for Gahagan bifaces included with Caddo burials, and significant morphological disparity in size between the populations. Contextual differences suggest two Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the `northern behavioral region` where Gahagan bifaces were placed _atop or alongside an individual_, and one more prevalent in the `southern behavioral region` where Gahagan bifaces were _included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial_. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by a distinct community of practice relating to the placement and shape of the Gahagan bifaces used in each context.

While the northern community of practice appears to have been in operation at the same time as that of the southern community of practice, evidenced by individuals buried at Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis with Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside them, the inverse is not currently supported by the archaeological record. This raises questions regarding whether the northern burial tradition predates that of the south, and/or whether the `spatial boundary` may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components \citep{RN8312,RN8313,RN8299}, which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology \citep{RN8207,RN8965,RN8154,RN8318,RN9364,RN11064}, and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results \citep{RN10760}. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress \citep{RN10761}.
