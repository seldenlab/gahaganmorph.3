    "text": "Primary findings\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory hypotheses include a, an increase in mortuary assemblage diversity as the Caddo became more sedentary during their shift from a horticulturalist lifeway to one of emergent agriculturalist; and b, an increase in morphological diversity through the technological life cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nASSEMBLAGE DIVERSITY\nHypothesis: Caddo mortuary assemblages associated with Gahagan bifaces increase in diversity subsequent to their initial use in mortuary offerings.\nThis hypothesis is tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds site where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative abundance of a, adults and juveniles (binned to include all non-adults); b, lithic and ceramic artifacts; and c, diagnostic artefact types recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts that included a Gahagan biface. Contexts ordered temporally from bottom to top based on results of seriation (see Chapter 2). The middle two contexts (16RR1-BP2 and 16CD12-BP5) are interchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\nJuveniles are not present in the three latest assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces\nLithics comprise 75% or more—in three cases, 100%—of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered\nCaddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include a significantly greater diversity of associated diagnostics\nCaddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include significantly greater evenness across the types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaddo burial assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces; 1, 16CD12-BP8; 2, 16CD12-BP2; 3, 41CE19-F119; 4, 16RR1-BP2; 5, 16CD12-BP5; 6, 16RR1-BP3; 7, 41CE19-F134; 8, 16CD12-BP1. The three sites in the lower part of the left quadrat exhibit lower diversity and evenness, and represent the three earliest contexts to include a Gahagan biface. Those sites in the upper right quadrat have higher diversity and evenness, and occur later than those in the lower left quadrat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of results\nThe hypothesis was tested using counts of associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mound sites where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assessed whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. Results follow with an expected increase in assemblage diversity during the cultural and subsistence-based transition from mobile horticulture to emergent—and more sedentary—agricultural communities.\nResults demonstrate that lithics comprise 75% or more, in three cases, 100%, of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered, as well as a significant increase in the diversity and evenness of diagnostic artefacts included in Caddo burial contexts with Gahagan bifaces. This general trend articulates with the development, maintenance, and evolution associated with a Caddo burial practice. These assemblages are dominated by lithic diagnostics, and ceramics are absent from three of the burial contexts. Further discussion related to those diagnostic types that do/do not transcend specific spatial and temporal boundaries are included in the manuscript.\n\n\n\nOBJECT PLACEMENT\nHypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as part of a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.\nThis hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference.\n\nFindings:\n\nGahagan bifaces differ significantly in shape between cache and individual contexts\nGahagan bifaces do not differ in size between cache and individual contexts\nGahagan bifaces from individual contexts exhibit significantly greater size diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of mean shapes, gray dots represent cache contexts, and black dots represent individual contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of results\nContextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where all but six Gahagan bifaces were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its’ own community of practice relating both to placement and the design (shape) of Gahagan bifaces interred in each context.\n\n\n\nTEMPORAL TRAJECTORIES\nHypothesis 1 (Morphology): Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through time—initial vs. subsequent deposition—as mortuary assemblage diversity increases.\nHypothesis 2 (Morphological Diversity): Morphological diversity in Gahagan bifaces increases through the technological life cycle\nThese hypotheses are tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased.\nThe analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time:\n\nInitial Individual: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual\nInitial Cache: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature\nSubsequent Individual: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual\nSubsequent Cache: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature\n\n\nFindings:\nMorphology:\n\nGahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape\nGahagan bifaces from Subsequent Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape\nGahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Initial Individual contexts differ significantly in size\nGahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Cache contexts differ significantly in size\nGahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in size\n\nMorphological Diversity:\n\nGahagan bifaces from subsequent contexts are not more diverse in shape than those from initial contexts\nGahagan bifaces from initial contexts placed atop/alongside individuals exhibit significantly greater size diversity than those from initial cache contexts, as well as those from subsequent individual and cache contexts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the comparison of Gahagan bifaces from discrete burial contexts, gray dots represent the mean shape at the top of the column, and black dots represent the mean shape at right. All comparisons in the first column differ significantly in size, those in the second column differ significantly in shape, and those in the third column do not differ in shape or size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of results\nThese hypotheses were tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual from the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential preference as Caddo mortuary assemblage diversity increased.\n\nResults demonstrate that in the earliest Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in size (are larger) when compared with those placed in caches found along the northern wall of the burial pit.\nIn the later burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in shape when compared with those placed in caches found along the northern wall of the burial pit.\nCaches of Gahagan bifaces found along the northern wall of Caddo burial pits exhibit morphological stability through time in that they differ neither in shape nor size as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increases.\nThe hypothesis that morphological diversity in Gahagan bifaces increases through the technological life cycle is rejected. Gahagan bifaces from initial contexts that were placed atop or alongside an individual expressed a greater diversity in size than all other categories. Thus, for the comparison of Gahagan biface morphological diversity through time among contexts, those found with individuals express stability in shape, but the inverse of the hypothesis in size (becoming less diverse in size through time), while those from cache contexts express morphological stability in both shape and size through time.\n\nThe temporal attribute used for the GM analysis is comprised of the same initial and subsequent contexts used in the analysis of Caddo mortuary assemblage diversity. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioural region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction."

The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.\nReproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaitė et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018)."

Robinson developed the method of seriation by permuting distance matrices. He used a similarity matrix where 200 was the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent decreases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The seriation package implements this as a manhattan distance matrix where 0 is the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent increases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The AR measure (Anti-Robinson) counts the number of times there is a decrease between adjacent values. The AR_deviation measure weights the index by the difference in values. These are loss measures meaning that low values are better. The Gradient_raw and Gradient_weighted indices are similar, but look at triplets. These are merit measures meaning that higher values are better. There are other options, but these are relatively straightforward.\nThe seriation package has multiple methods for seriating distance matrices. The ARSA (Anti-Robinson seriation by simulated annealing) method attempts to minimize the linear seriation criterion defined by Robinson. Two other methods use branch and bound algorithms (BBURCG and BBWRCG) focus on the gradient measures.\nThe five ordinations are then compared to the original order of the data. The detrended correspondence ordering is better than the correspondence ordering, but the permutation orderings are better. The ARSA and BBWRCG oderings are the same and the BBURCG ordering differs only by the switching of the positions of 16RR1-BP2 (S) and 16CD12-BP5 (N). The first (and third) orderings have the best values for AR_deviations (lowest) and Gradient_weighted (highest) whereas the second ordering has the best values for AR_events (lowest) and Gradient_raw (highest).\nThe battleship plot shows the first ordering.\n\nlibrary(seriation)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'seriation':\n  method         from \n  reorder.hclust vegan\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'seriation'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lattice':\n\n    panel.lines\n\ngahagan_dist <- dist(gahagan_pct, method=\"manhattan\")\n# Distance matrix:\nround(gahagan_dist, 1)\n\n                41CE19-F134 (S) 41CE19-F119 (S) 16RR1-BP2 (S) 16RR1-BP3 (S)\n41CE19-F119 (S)           127.2                                            \n16RR1-BP2 (S)             113.8            90.9                            \n16RR1-BP3 (S)              28.0           124.6          92.7              \n16CD12-BP1 (N)             38.0           134.8         117.7          40.0\n16CD12-BP2 (N)            166.1            71.6         140.6         159.4\n16CD12-BP5 (N)            133.8           138.5          85.3         116.4\n16CD12-BP8 (N)            182.6           157.6         146.3         154.8\n                16CD12-BP1 (N) 16CD12-BP2 (N) 16CD12-BP5 (N)\n41CE19-F119 (S)                                             \n16RR1-BP2 (S)                                               \n16RR1-BP3 (S)                                               \n16CD12-BP1 (N)                                              \n16CD12-BP2 (N)           167.2                              \n16CD12-BP5 (N)           122.4          133.5               \n16CD12-BP8 (N)           178.3          175.0          165.7\n\nset.seed(42)\ngahagan_ser1 <- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=\"ARSA\")\ngahagan_ser2 <- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=\"BBURCG\")\ngahagan_ser3 <- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=\"BBWRCG\")\nord1 <- get_order(gahagan_ser1)\nord2 <- get_order(gahagan_ser2)\nord3 <- get_order(gahagan_ser3)\n# Suggested orderings\nrbind(ord1, ord2, ord3)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]\nord1    5    1    4    7    3    2    6    8\nord2    5    1    4    3    7    2    6    8\nord3    5    1    4    7    3    2    6    8\n\nCrit <- c(\"AR_events\", \"AR_deviations\", \"Gradient_raw\", \"Gradient_weighted\")\ngahagan_ord1 <- permute(gahagan_dist, ord1)\ngahagan_ord2 <- permute(gahagan_dist, ord2)\ngahagan_ord3 <- permute(gahagan_dist, ord3)\ngahagan_dec_ord <- permute(gahagan_dist, dec_ord)\ngahagan_ca_ord <- permute(gahagan_dist, ca_ord)\n\n# Comparison between original and ordered:\nResults <- list(Original=gahagan_dist, Ordered1=gahagan_ord1, Ordered2=gahagan_ord2, Ordered3=gahagan_ord3, CA=gahagan_ca_ord, DEC=gahagan_dec_ord)\nround(sapply(Results, criterion, method=Crit), 1)\n\n                  Original Ordered1 Ordered2 Ordered3     CA    DEC\nAR_events             44.0     19.0     17.0     19.0   49.0   32.0\nAR_deviations       1709.3    217.0    228.4    217.0 2335.2  584.1\nGradient_raw          24.0     74.0     78.0     74.0   14.0   48.0\nGradient_weighted   1227.1   3990.6   3956.5   3990.6  253.6 3176.5\n\nbattleship.plot(gahagan_pct[ord1, ], col=\"gray\", cex.labels = .75)\n\n\n\n\nSince there are only eight contexts, it is feasible to consider all possible orderings to see if the preceding analysis found the best ordering.

However, given the relatively small sample sizes, it may be that sampling fluctuations could make other orderings better.\nRunning the North and South groups separately produces the same orderings (although South is reversed). Since the tied contexts were one North and one South, it did not have any effect on the separate orderings.\n\n# North contexts\nnorth <- grep(\"(N)\", rownames(gahagan_pct))\nnorth_pct <- gahagan_pct[north, ]\nnorth_dist <- dist(north_pct, method=\"manhattan\")\nnorthrows <- nrow(north_pct)\nnorthperm <- permutations(northrows)\nnorthnperm <- factorial(northrows) / 2\n# There are only 12 permutations to check\nnorth_perms <- t(sapply(seq(northnperm), function(i) criterion(north_dist, northperm[i,], method=Crit)))\nround(north_perms, 1)\n\n      AR_events AR_deviations Gradient_raw Gradient_weighted\n [1,]         2          55.8            4              77.7\n [2,]         2          37.0            4             101.0\n [3,]         2          15.8            4             164.6\n [4,]         1           9.3            6             184.2\n [5,]         3          55.6            2              45.2\n [6,]         5          80.9           -2               2.4\n [7,]         4         117.9            0              11.5\n [8,]         4          92.6            0              54.3\n [9,]         6         138.9           -4             -84.7\n[10,]         7         183.0           -6            -150.7\n[11,]         6         228.6           -4            -214.3\n[12,]         6         209.9           -4            -191.1\n\nnorthbest <- c(which.min(north_perms[, \"AR_events\"]), which.min(north_perms[, \"AR_deviations\"]),\n     which.max(north_perms[, \"Gradient_raw\"]), which.max(north_perms[, \"Gradient_weighted\"]))\n# All four criteria agree on permutation 4\nnorthbest\n\n[1] 4 4 4 4\n\nnorth_ser <- northperm[northbest[1], ]\nrownames(north_pct)[north_ser]\n\n[1] \"16CD12-BP1 (N)\" \"16CD12-BP5 (N)\" \"16CD12-BP2 (N)\" \"16CD12-BP8 (N)\"\n\nbattleship.plot(north_pct[north_ser, ], col=\"gray\", cex.labels = .75)\n\n\n\n# South contexts\nsouth <- grep(\"(S)\", rownames(gahagan_pct))\nsouth_pct <- gahagan_pct[south, ]\nsouth_dist <- dist(south_pct, method=\"manhattan\")\nsouthrows <- nrow(south_pct)\nsouthperm <- permutations(southrows)\nsouthnperm <- factorial(southrows) / 2\n# There are only 12 permutations to check\nsouth_perms <- t(sapply(seq(southnperm), function(i) criterion(south_dist, southperm[i,], method=Crit)))\nround(south_perms, 1)\n\n      AR_events AR_deviations Gradient_raw Gradient_weighted\n [1,]         5         359.7           -2            -271.3\n [2,]         5         212.1           -2             -50.0\n [3,]         2          23.7            4             252.8\n [4,]         5         378.2           -2            -326.8\n [5,]         6         307.8           -4            -241.3\n [6,]         4          68.9            0             116.9\n [7,]         0           0.0            8             323.8\n [8,]         4         185.9            0             -34.5\n [9,]         5         115.5           -2              51.0\n[10,]         2          45.3            4             187.9\n[11,]         5         244.6           -2            -114.9\n[12,]         5          97.0           -2             106.4\n\nsouthbest <- c(which.min(south_perms[, \"AR_events\"]), which.min(south_perms[, \"AR_deviations\"]),\n     which.max(south_perms[, \"Gradient_raw\"]), which.max(south_perms[, \"Gradient_weighted\"]))\n# All four criteria agree on permuation 7\nsouthbest\n\n[1] 7 7 7 7\n\nsouth_ser <- southperm[southbest[1], ]\nrownames(south_pct)[south_ser]\n\n[1] \"41CE19-F119 (S)\" \"16RR1-BP2 (S)\"   \"16RR1-BP3 (S)\"   \"41CE19-F134 (S)\"\n\n# Reverse South for battlship plot\nbattleship.plot(south_pct[rev(south_ser), ], col=\"gray\", cex.labels = .75)"

    "text": "The analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity is limited to Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mound sites where Gahagan bifaces were recovered. We begin by looking at taxonomic composition, where the rows are reordered based on seriation results. Then to Alpha diversity and relative abundance, followed by Beta diversity. The Alpha and Beta diversity results raised the question of a potential increase in diversity through time.\nHypothesis: Caddo mortuary assemblages associated with Gahagan bifaces increase in diversity subsequent to their initial use in mortuary offerings.\nThis hypothesis was tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds sites where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as Caddo burial practices evolved."

    "text": "Two Gahagan bifaces, both from the George C. Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum.\nModeling was completed in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.4 [Build Number: 15]). In the previous studies (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), modeling occurred in advance of alignment, which used the auto3dgm package in R (Boyer et al. 2015; R Core Development Team, 2021). In this iteration, modeling still occurs first, followed by a novel method for assigning the front and back faces of each specimen. Details associated with that method are included in the next chapter. Following alignment, these specimens were landmarked using the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces.\nIn both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in (Selden Jr. 2017).\nThe images that follow include a before and after modeling image of each biface, illustrating the area of the biface that was missing, and the subsequent model that was used in the geometric morphometric analysis. In the case of 4078-8, a single semilandmark was included in the modeled area. No semilandmarks were placed in the modeled area of 4078-72."

    "text": "The landmarking protocol developed for this project bears some visual similarities with the configuration used in the previous study (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), as well as other two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses (Buchanan and Collard 2010; Buchanan et al. 2011; Ragan and Buchanan 2018); however, it differs in some fundamental ways. The first and most obvious difference is that this is a three-dimensional study. The second is the method of landmark placement, where Geomagic Design X was used to generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks in a replicable manner using mathematically-defined criteria.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/figbev.png')\n\n\n\n\nGahagan biface 545 from the Gahagan Mound site, illustrating axial twisting. \n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this effort was to increase the precision and rigour of the study by including the z-dimension to capture those morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting that are introduced through the practice of bifacial beveling. This landmarking protocol represents an intermediate iteration between the previous 2D analysis (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), and the forthcoming protocol that also includes semilandmarks placed on a series of equidistant cross-sections. The cross-sections increase the coverage of semilandmarks across the mesh topology, and provide for greater precision in the analysis of morphology for the whole object. The evolution of this landmarking protocol represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some landmarking protocols can be—and often are—recycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration.\n\nGenerating the spline\nUnlike the previous study, where the outline of each Gahagan biface was projected onto a 2D plane, this effort enlists a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command, which is used to detect and extract 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network that is used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the biface. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at four mathematically-defined locations.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/extractspline.png')\n\n\n\n\nSpline extracted along the highest contours of the projectile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitting the spline\nA few definitions are warranted before proceeding. Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features.\nThe characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Gahagan biface. The second and third splits (LM2 and LM3) occur at points of highest curvature, and LM2 is always split on the right side of the biface when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of auto3dgm, which is illustrated in Figure 7a of the manuscript. To place the final landmark (LM4), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM2 and LM3. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM4.\n\nSpline split at location of LM1\nThe horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the 2D sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The 3D spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/lm1.png')\n\n\n\n\nIdentify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpline split at locations of LM2 and LM3\nThe point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each biface where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output (see Figure 7a in the manuscript), and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM3 on the left.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/splinesplit1.png')\n\n\n\n\nIdentify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpline split at location of LM4\nOne additional landmark (LM4) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/lm4.png')\n\n\n\n\nCalculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal spline\nThrough the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into four discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of bifacial morphology that can be compartmentalised in the subsequent analyses (i.e., left/right [directional] asymmetry, blade/base morphological integration, etc.). The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Gahagan biface morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/splinesplit-frbl.png')\n\n\n\n\nResult of spline splits include four discrete splines, each articulating with a potential region of analytical interest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandmark and semilandmark placement\nLandmarks 1-4 were placed at the location of each spline split (blue points, below). Equidistant semilandmarks were then added to each of the four splines; 20 between LM1 and LM2, five between LM2 and LM4, five between LM4 and LM3, and 20 between LM3 and LM1.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/lmslm-all.png')\n\n\n\n\n3D spline with landmarks (blue) and equidistant semilandmarks (white) applied, with top, right, and front planes. Semilandmarks are renumbered in post. \n\n\n\n\nSuperficially, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks appears similar to those used in recent 2D studies. However, the rigourous protocol used in the application of landmarks and semilandmarks aids in capturing morphological variation that articulates with axial twisting introduced by knappers through the practice of beveling. Thus, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks provides for greater precision in the geometric morphometric analysis, marking a substantive advancement in those analytical protocols used to achieve a more complete and holistic analysis of Gahagan biface morphology.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('images/figbevlm.png')\n\n\n\n\nMesh for Gahagan biface 545 from Gahagan Mound with landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks applied. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBirkhoff, George D. 1933.

    "text": "This 3D geometric morphometric analysis follows recent analyses of Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), where Gahagan bifaces were found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, this volume). The analysis, and the two that precede it, builds upon the work of Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly.\nHypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as part of a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.\nThis hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference."

    "text": "This 3D geometric morphometric analysis follows recent analyses of Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), where Gahagan bifaces were found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, this volume). The analysis, and the two that precede it, builds upon the work of Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly.\nHypothesis 1 (Morphology): Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through time—initial vs. subsequent deposition—as mortuary assemblage diversity increases.\nHypothesis 2 (Morphological Diversity): The morphological diversity of Gahagan bifaces increases through the technological life cycle\nThis hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased.\nThe analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time:"

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\n\nY.gpa <- gpagen(coords,\n                PrinAxes = TRUE,\n                print.progress = FALSE)\n## plot gpa\nplot(Y.gpa)\n\n## 3D gpa plot\nknitr::include_graphics('images/gpa3d.png')\n\n\n\n# geomorph data frame\ngdf <- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords,\n                           size = Y.gpa$Csize,\n                           merged = qdata$merged,\n                           temporal = qdata$t.context,\n                           context = qdata$context) \n\n# add centroid size to qdata\nqdata$csz <- Y.gpa$Csize\n\n# attributes for boxplot\ncsz <- qdata$csz\nmerged <- qdata$merged\n\n# palette\npal <- wes_palette(\"Moonrise2\", 4, type = \"continuous\")"

To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by context (context), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015).\n\n# MODEL: shape as a function of context + time\nfit.shapecontemp <- procD.lm(shape ~ merged,\n                             data = gdf,\n                             print.progress = FALSE,\n                             iter = 9999)\n\n# ANOVA: do gahagan biface shapes differ by context + time?\nanova(fit.shapecontemp)\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization\nPermutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals \nNumber of permutations: 10000 \nEstimation method: Ordinary Least Squares \nSums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I \nEffect sizes (Z) based on F distributions\n\n          Df      SS        MS     Rsq      F      Z Pr(>F)    \nmerged     3 0.07959 0.0265306 0.24696 6.8871 3.4405  1e-04 ***\nResiduals 63 0.24269 0.0038522 0.75304                         \nTotal     66 0.32228                                           \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nCall: procD.lm(f1 = shape ~ merged, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE)\n\n# pairwise comparison of LS means = which differ?\npairwise.shapecontemp <- pairwise(fit.shapecontemp,\n                                  groups = qdata$merged)\nsummary(pairwise.shapecontemp, \n        confidence = 0.95, \n        test.type = \"dist\")\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\n\nGroups: initial_cache initial_individual subsequent_cache subsequent_individual \n\nRRPP: 10000 permutations\n\nLS means:\nVectors hidden (use show.vectors = TRUE to view)\n\nPairwise distances between means, plus statistics\n                                                  d  UCL (95%)          Z\ninitial_cache:initial_individual         0.05689191 0.06789423  1.3220896\ninitial_cache:subsequent_cache           0.01516509 0.03446703 -0.1269755\ninitial_cache:subsequent_individual      0.08386209 0.04232262  2.9240533\ninitial_individual:subsequent_cache      0.05951226 0.06704768  1.4408328\ninitial_individual:subsequent_individual 0.04466037 0.07023648  0.7341184\nsubsequent_cache:subsequent_individual   0.08100191 0.04105631  2.9828667\n                                         Pr > d\ninitial_cache:initial_individual         0.1042\ninitial_cache:subsequent_cache           0.5384\ninitial_cache:subsequent_individual      0.0002\ninitial_individual:subsequent_cache      0.0857\ninitial_individual:subsequent_individual 0.2490\nsubsequent_cache:subsequent_individual   0.0001\n\n# MODEL: size as a function of context + time\nfit.sizecontemp <- procD.lm(size ~ merged,\n                            data = gdf,\n                            print.progress = FALSE,\n                            iter = 9999)\n\n# ANOVA: do gahagan biface sizes differ by context + time?\nanova(fit.sizecontemp)\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization\nPermutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals \nNumber of permutations: 10000 \nEstimation method: Ordinary Least Squares \nSums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I \nEffect sizes (Z) based on F distributions\n\n          Df      SS     MS     Rsq      F      Z Pr(>F)    \nmerged     3  638396 212799 0.46852 18.512 5.0037  1e-04 ***\nResiduals 63  724190  11495 0.53148                         \nTotal     66 1362586                                        \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nCall: procD.lm(f1 = size ~ merged, iter = 9999, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE)\n\n# pairwise comparison of LS means = which differ?\npairwise.sizecontemp <- pairwise(fit.sizecontemp,\n                                 groups = qdata$merged)\nsummary(pairwise.sizecontemp, \n        confidence = 0.95, \n        test.type = \"dist\")\n\n\nPairwise comparisons\n\nGroups: initial_cache initial_individual subsequent_cache subsequent_individual \n\nRRPP: 10000 permutations\n\nLS means:\nVectors hidden (use show.vectors = TRUE to view)\n\nPairwise distances between means, plus statistics\n                                                  d UCL (95%)          Z Pr > d\ninitial_cache:initial_individual         420.367335 153.20598  3.6341959 0.0001\ninitial_cache:subsequent_cache            63.857495  77.82881  1.2287925 0.1126\ninitial_cache:subsequent_individual        4.252466  96.92282 -1.5609099 0.9317\ninitial_individual:subsequent_cache      356.509840 154.07650  3.2832616 0.0002\ninitial_individual:subsequent_individual 416.114869 163.99286  3.4679877 0.0001\nsubsequent_cache:subsequent_individual    59.605029  94.06328  0.8294343 0.2222"
