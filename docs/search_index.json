Selden, Jr.1, John E. Dockall2, Christian S. Hoggard3, and David K. Thulman4 2021-10-05 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry Gahagan bifaces represent one of three categories of Caddo material culture that express a significant differences in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles and Perdiz arrow points (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2021). The morphology of Gahagan bifaces from sites in central Texas was also found to differ significantly when compared with those recovered from the ancestral Caddo area (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). That Gahagan bifaces have been found to differ across two spatial boundaries was noteworthy, particularly since it is regularly assumed that they were manufactured in central Texas and arrived in the ancestral Caddo area as products of trade or exchange (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). Further, that Gahagan bifaces were found to differ across the same geographic area as Caddo bottles suggested that the temporal range of the shape boundary might extend to the Formative/Early Caddo period (CE 800 - 1250); a notion that was later confirmed in a more comprehensive analysis of Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2021). This study shifts the analytical foci of the research program from one of regional trends to one of local Caddo burial contexts. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered with an individual denoted by black circles. Additional information for each bifaces, including the option to download 2D images of these bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Temporal change in preference Hypothesis 1: Gahagan bifaces selected for inclusion in Caddo burials differ in morphology through time. Hypothesis 1 is tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts from the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing temporal positions. The information gathered from the analysis provides valuable insights with regard to design intent (for central Texas makers) and aesthetic preference (for Caddo users) that articulate with Gahagan bifaces at different temporal intervals. 0.2.1.1 Hypothesis 1a: Temporal change in preference at Mounds Plantation In assessing a temporal change in preference between populations of bifaces from Mounds Plantation, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1 in Mound 5, cutting downward from the mounds surface. The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that the burial occurred after those burials associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1a.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.1: Stratigraphic position of Burial Pits 1 and 2 at the Mounds Plantation site; adapted from Webb (1975:Figure 7). Burial Pit 2 is the only burial found to be intrusive from the mound surface. 0.2.1.1.1 Hypothesis 1a Findings: 0.2.1.2 Hypothesis 1b: Temporal change in preference at George C. Davis To assess the temporal change in preference between populations of bifaces from George C. Davis, those recovered from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119. The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred after those associated with Feature 134. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1b.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.2: Stratigraphic position of Features 119 and 134 at the George C. Davis site; adapted from Story (1997:Figure 13). 0.2.1.2.1 Hypothesis 1b Findings: 0.2.2 General morphological trajectory Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache offering differ in morphology from those placed with an individual. Hypothesis 2 is tested using a sample of Gahagan bifaces interred as part of a Caddo group offering (henceforth called a cache) or with a Caddo individual. Findings provide useful insights with regard to macro trends associated with the use-life of Gahagan bifaces, which may have ranged from a cache offering (where design intent is assumed) to an individual offering (where minor modification(s)/retouch may be present). 0.2.2.1 Hypothesis 2 Findings: 0.3 Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, the Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science for the requisite permissions and access needed to generate the 3D scans of the Gahagan bifaces. Thanks to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments on the analyses of Gahagan biface shape. RZS extend his gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms on an earlier draft of LM3d1, as well as the landmarking protocol used in this study (LM3d2). Thanks to Martin Hinz for fielding questions related to the oxcAAR package, and to Derek Hamilton for his guidance with the chronological models, and to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Lauren Butaric, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. 0.4 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. 0.5 Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).

Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum. Modeling was completed in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2019.0.2 [Build Number: 78]). Modeling occurred in advance of the auto3dgm alignment. Following alignment, these two specimens were landmarked following the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces. In both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following with the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in (Selden Jr. 2017). The images that follow include a before and after modeling image of each biface, illustrating the area of the biface that was missing, and the subsequent model that was used in the geometric morphometric analysis. In the case of 4078-8, one semilandmark was included in the modeled area.

This protocol represents the continued evolution of a research programme concerned with the development of a rigorous and replicable three-dimensional (3D) landmarking workflow, which simultaneously takes into account the unique and complex design elements associated with individual bifaces. Landmark (LM) and semilandmark (sLM) placement was achieved through the construction of reference geometry in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.2 [Build Number: 55]), used to expand upon the previous LM configuration, and capitalise upon additional design attributes. Reference geometry provides the requisite foundation needed to apply the LM and sLM points at mathematically-defined locations. The result is a LM and sLM configuration that articulates with specific morphological features (plan views, profiles, and cross-sections), which have demonstrated utility in wide-ranging studies of biface and projectile point morphology. 3.1 Foundations The initial landmarking protocol enlisted a curve that was projected onto a 2D plane. That protocol provided the framework needed to begin a more thorough consideration of 3D landmarking protocols, driving the evolution of the landmarking protocol described here. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gahaganmorph.jpg&#39;) (#fig:fig.gahaganmorph)The landmarking protocol used in the 2D analysis of Gahagan bifaces, where all landmarks and semilandmarks were projected onto a plane. The first 3D landmarking protocol (LM3d1) used for an analysis of Gahagan bifaces focused only upon the plan view (lateral/basal edges), and enlisted auto3dgm to achieve the principal alignments needed to assign the front and back to each face. While basic, this landmarking protocol generated the requisite framework needed to begin constructing different suites of design-driven reference geometry that can be tailored to address specific research questions. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gahaganmorph2.png&#39;) (#fig:fig.gahaganmorph2)The first 3D landmarking protocol (LM3d1) used to analyse Gahagan bifaces, which captured those attributes associated with axial twisting. The goal of this effort was to increase the precision and rigour of the study by including additional elements from the Z-dimension to capture morphological characteristics associated with plan, profile, and cross-sections. This landmarking protocol is the culmination of the iterative design process that began during the previous 2D (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018) and 3D (LM3d1) (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) geometric morphometric analyses, and includes fewer steps than LM3d3. The cross-sections increase the coverage of sLMs across mesh topology, providing for greater precision in the analysis of whole-object morphology, and can be subset as a means of analyzing specific features of interest. For this study, the previously-noted morphological differences that occur in plan view (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) are further scrutinized in an effort to explore whether those differences in Gahagan biface plan view might be said to extend to the profiles of Gahagan bifaces. Due to the degree of axial twisting that occurs across the sample, it is not possible to gather the data needed to answer this query using 2D methods. The continued evolution of this landmarking protocol represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some landmarking protocols can beand often arerecycled as new specimens are added, this research program endeavors to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each subsequent iteration. 3.2 Generating the peripheral (plan view) spline This effort begins with a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network to construct a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of each biface (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at four mathematically-defined locations (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) Figure 3.1: Spline extracted along the highest contours of the projectile. 3.2.1 Splitting Spline 1 Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933), and have been gainfully employed within the context of both ceramic (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b) and lithic analyses (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). 3.2.1.1 Split Spline 1 at location of LM 01 The horizontal tangent was calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of each biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the 2D sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The 3D spline was cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) Figure 3.2: Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). 3.2.1.2 Split Spline 1 at locations of LM 02 and LM 03 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyzer. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous color plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. Curvature is displayed in different colors according to the local radius, and calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The orientation of each biface was initially dictated by the auto3dgm alignment in LM3d1; however, LM3d2 follows a different protocol. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) Figure 3.3: Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. 3.2.1.3 Split Spline 1 at location of LM 04 One additional landmark (LM 06) was placed at the center of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM 02 and LM 03, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm4.png&#39;) Figure 3.4: Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. 3.3 Reference geometry, Build 1 Each of the preceding protocols were used in the previous analysis of Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the following sections detail the evolution of that landmarking protocol. The resulting constellation of LM and sLM points can be subset to test a wide range of hypotheses associated with the plan and profile views of bifaces, and can be extended to include specific or multiple components of each cross-section. Each cross-section is also split between LM 01 and LM04, allowing for analyses of bilateral asymmetry for both plan and profile views. 3.3.1 Reference Vector 1, Point 2, and Plane 2 A linear reference vector (vector.1) was inserted between LM 01 and LM 04, and a reference point (ref.pt.2) was placed equidistant between LMs 02 and 03 along vector.1. The Z-coordinates of ref.pt.2 were altered to relocate it 15mm from vector.1 in the direction of the Z-axis, while otherwise maintaining its alignment with vector 1. The pick point and coplanar function was used to place a reference plane (ref.pl.2) along vector.1 in the direction of ref.pt.2, bisecting the biface along the Z-axisperpendicular to the lateral edgesbetween LM 01 and LM 04. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/vecptplane.png&#39;) Figure 3.5: Vector.1 placed between LM 01 and 04, ref.pt.2 equidistant between the landmarks along vector.1. Z-coordinates altered to offset the point 15mm from vector.1 (left two images). Vector.1 and ref.pt.2 were used to place a ref.pl.2 coplanar to the vector in the direction of ref.pt.2 using the pick point and coplanar axis function (right two images). 3.3.2 Reference Planes 3 and 4 Using the same method, a reference vector (vector.2) was inserted between LM 02 and LM 03 using the same reference point. The Z-coordinates of ref.pt.3 were similarly altered to relocate it 15 mm from vector.2 in the direction of the Z-axis. The pick point and coplanar axis function was used to place a reference plane ref.pl.3 along vector.2 in the direction of ref.pt.3, bisecting the biface along the X-axisparallel to the basebetween LM 02 and LM 03. A fourth reference plane ref.pl.4 was inserted using the pick point and normal axis function, placing a plane at the intersection of LM 01 and vector.1. These two planes serve as the basis for the equidistant cross-sections. The angle between the ref.pl.2 and ref.pl.3 was measured on each side of ref.pl.2, and the side with the lowest angle was kept on the right during the remainder of the landmarking process. LMs 02 and 03 were assigned following this calculation. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/plane3-4.png&#39;) (#fig:plane3.4)Vector placed between LM 01 and 04, ref.pt.2 equidistant between the landmarks along the vector, then the Z-coordinates were altered to offset the point 15mm from the vector (left two images). The vector and ref.pt.3 were subsequently used to place a plane coplanar to the vector in the direction of ref.pt.3 using the pick point and coplanar axis function. Plane 4 was inserted using the pick point and normal axis function with vector1 as the normal axis, and LM 01 as the pick point. 3.4 Cross-sections Twelve equidistant curves were inserted between the ref.pl.3 and ref.pl.4 using the section function, and those that bisected the biface at the location of LM 01 and LM 04 were deleted. The resulting 10 curves were split at the points of highest curvature along the lateral edges, then along the mid-line at the point where they intersect with ref.pl.2. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/cross.10.png&#39;) (#fig:cross.10)Ten equidistant cross-sections were inserted between Plane 3 and Plane 4. 3.4.1 Splitting the curves (Step 1) Cross-sections were split at the intersection of each horizontal curve and ref.pl.2. The resulting reference geometry provides a means of analysing the contribution of bifacial morphology associated with the projectiles profile, and divides the landmarking configuration into two discrete components (plan and profile view) for use in the analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/cut.cross.plane2.png&#39;) (#fig:cut.cross.plane2)Cross-sections were cut where they intersect with Plane 2, along the mid-line of the projectile between LM 01 and LM 04. 3.4.2 Splitting the curves (Step 2) Each curve was split at the two points of highest curvature along the lateral edges of the biface. These sLMs contribute to the analysis of the projectile in plan view, and follow the dynamicand unique3D contours associated with the lateral edge of each biface. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/pt.high.curv.split.png&#39;) (#fig:pt.high.curv.split)Spline splits (blue dots) along the lateral edges occur at the point of highest curvature. These splits occur at known coordinates used to add the semilandmarks. 3.5 Landmark and semilandmark placement Landmarks were placed at the locations of spline splits following the same protocol enlisted by the previous study (blue points, below) (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). Two equidistant sLMs were added between LM 02 and LM 04, and between LM 04 and LM 03. Along the lateral edges, sLMs were numbered from the top right, then from top/front along the mid-line. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lmslm-allplanes.png&#39;) Figure 3.6: Reference geometry and 3D curves with landmarks (blue) and semilandmarks (white) applied. The resulting constellation of LMs and sLMs can be parsed and divided to answer wide-ranging morphological questions related to Gahagan bifaces, marking a substantive advancement in the analysis of Gahagan biface morphology. The design of the reference geometry used in LM3d2 is extensible, and the semilandmark configuration can expanded or contracted as the research programmeand research questionsevolves.

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).

The analysis builds upon previous discussions and analyses conducted by Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly. 6.1 Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache offering differ in morphology from those placed with an individual. Hypothesis 2 is tested using a sample of Gahagan bifaces interred as part of a Caddo group offering (here called a cache) or with a Caddo individual. Findings provide useful insights with regard to macro trends associated with the use-life of Gahagan bifaces, which may have ranged from a cache offering (where design intent is assumed) to an individual offering (where minor modification(s)/retouch may be present). 6.2 Load packages + data # load libraries library(here) library(geomorph) library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./dataiCTX&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdataiCTX.csv&quot;,header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]], rownames(qdata)),] 6.3 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.0 (R Core Development Team, 2020) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.0 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013).
