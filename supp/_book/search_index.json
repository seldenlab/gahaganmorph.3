Selden, Jr.1, John E. Dockall2, and David L. Carlson3 2022-01-05 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry Contextual differences in Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces indicate two discrete burial traditions; one where a biface was placed atop or alongside an individual and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was placed along the northern wall of the burial feature. This exploratory study asks whether assemblage diversity and evenness, for mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifaces, increases through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on context. A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes in Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between Caddo burial traditions, indicating discrete communities of practice related to object placement and shape preference. These findings provide the basis for a discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a Caddo burial practice that occurs during the transition from a mobile horticulturist lifeway to one of emergentand more sedentaryagriculturalists. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan.bifaces)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions.

Hypothesis: Caddo mortuary assemblages associated with Gahagan bifaces increase in diversity subsequent to their initial use as mortuary offerings. This hypothesis is tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds site where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/abundance.png&#39;) Figure 0.2: Relative abundance of a, adults and juveniles (binned to include all non-adults); b, lithic and ceramic artifacts; and c, diagnostic artefact types recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts that included a Gahagan biface. Contexts ordered temporally from bottom to top based on results of seriation (see Chapter 2). The middle two contexts (16RR1-BP2 and 16CD12-BP5) are interchangeable. 0.2.1.1 Findings: Juveniles were not included in the three latest assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces Lithics comprise 75% or morein three cases, 100%of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include a significantly greater diversity of associated diagnostics Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include significantly greater evenness across the types knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/diversity2-1.png&#39;) (#fig:diversity.out)Caddo burial assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces; 1, 41CE19-F134; 2, 41CE19-F119; 3, 16RR1-BP2; 4, 16RR1-BP3; 5, 16CD12-BP1; 6, 16CD12-BP2; 7, 16CD12-BP5; 8, 16CD12-BP8. The three sites in the lower part of the left quadrat exhibit lower diversity and evenness, and each represents the earliest context at each site to include a Gahagan biface. Those sites in the upper right quadrat have higher diversity and evenness, and occur later than those in the lower left quadrat. 0.2.1.2 Summary of results The hypothesis was tested using counts of associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mound sites where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assessed whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. This follows with an expected increase in assemblage diversity during the cultural and subsistence-based transition from mobile horticulture to emergentand more sedentaryagricultural communities. Results demonstrate that lithics comprise 75% or morein three cases, 100%of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered, as well as a significant increase in the diversity and evenness of diagnostic artefacts included in Caddo burial contexts with Gahagan bifaces. This general trend articulates with the development, maintenance, and evolution associated with a Caddo burial practice. These assemblages are dominated by lithic diagnostics, and ceramics are absent from three of the burial contexts. Further discussion related to diagnostic types that do/do not transcend specific spatial and temporal boundaries are included in the manuscript. 0.2.2 OBJECT PLACEMENT Research question: Does Gahagan biface morphology differ by burial context? Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as part of a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference. 0.2.2.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces differ significantly in shape between cache and individual contexts Gahagan bifaces do not differ in size between cache and individual contexts Gahagan bifaces from individual contexts exhibit significantly greater variation in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/mshape-cache-ind.jpg&#39;) (#fig:b.context)Comparison of Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of mean shapes, gray dots represent cache contexts, and black dots represent individual contexts. 0.2.2.2 Summary of results Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where six Gahagan bifaces were buried atop or alongside an individual, and the remainder were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating both to biface placement, and the design (shape) of Gahagan bifaces interred in each context. 0.2.3 TRAJECTORIES OF CHANGE Research question: Does Gahagan biface morphology change through time as mortuary assemblage diversity increases? Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through timeinitial vs. subsequent depositionas mortuary assemblage diversity increases. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased. The analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time: Initial Individual: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Initial Cache: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature Subsequent Individual: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Subsequent Cache: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature 0.2.3.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Subsequent Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Initial Individual contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Cache contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/comp.composite.jpg&#39;) (#fig:b.context.temporal)In the comparison of Gahagan bifaces from discrete burial contexts, gray dots represent the mean shape at the top of the column, and black dots represent the mean shape at right. All comparisons in the first column differ significantly in size, those in the second column differ significantly in shape, and those in the third column do not differ in shape or size. 0.2.3.2 Summary of results This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential preference as Caddo mortuary assemblage diversity increased. Results demonstrate that in the earliest Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in size (are larger) when compared with those placed in caches along the northern wall of the burial pit. In the later burials that included Gahagan bifaces, those bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual differ significantly in shape when compared with those placed in caches along the northern wall of the burial pit. Caches of Gahagan bifaces found along the northern wall of Caddo burial pits exhibit morphological stability through time in that they neither differ in shape nor size as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increases. The temporal attribute used for the GM analysis is comprised of the same initial and subsequent contexts used in the analysis of assemblage diversity. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioral region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).

Robinson developed the method of seriation by permuting distance matrices. He used a similarity matrix where 200 was the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent decreases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The seriation package implements this as a manhattan distance matrix where 0 is the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent increases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The AR measure (Anti-Robinson) counts the number of times there is a decrease between adjacent values. The AR_deviation measure weights the index by the difference in values. These are loss measures meaning that low values are better. The Gradient_raw and Gradient_weighted indices are similar, but look at triplets. These are merit measures meaning that higher values are better. There are other options, but these are relatively straightforward. The seriation package has multiple methods for seriating distance matrices. The ARSA (Anti-Robinson seriation by simulated annealing) method attempts to minimize the linear seriation criterion defined by Robinson. Two other methods use branch and bound algorithms (BBURCG and BBWRCG) focus on the gradient measures. The five ordinations are then compared to the original order of the data. The detrended correspondence ordering is better than the correspondence ordering, but the permutation orderings are better. The ARSA and BBWRCG oderings are the same and the BBURCG ordering differs only by the switching of the positions of 16RR1-BP2 (S) and 16CD12-BP5 (N). The first (and third) orderings have the best values for AR_deviations (lowest) and Gradient_weighted (highest) whereas the second ordering has the best values for AR_events (lowest) and Gradient_raw (highest). The battleship plot shows the first ordering. library(seriation) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;seriation&#39;: ## method from ## reorder.hclust vegan ## ## Attaching package: &#39;seriation&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:lattice&#39;: ## ## panel.lines gahagan_dist &lt;- dist(gahagan_pct, method=&quot;manhattan&quot;) # Distance matrix: round(gahagan_dist, 1) ## 41CE19-F134 (S) 41CE19-F119 (S) 16RR1-BP2 (S) ## 41CE19-F119 (S) 127.2 ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) 113.8 90.9 ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) 28.0 124.6 92.7 ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 38.0 134.8 117.7 ## 16CD12-BP2 (N) 166.1 71.6 140.6 ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) 133.8 138.5 85.3 ## 16CD12-BP8 (N) 182.6 157.6 146.3 ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) 16CD12-BP1 (N) 16CD12-BP2 (N) ## 41CE19-F119 (S) ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 40.0 ## 16CD12-BP2 (N) 159.4 167.2 ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) 116.4 122.4 133.5 ## 16CD12-BP8 (N) 154.8 178.3 175.0 ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) ## 41CE19-F119 (S) ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) ## 16CD12-BP2 (N) ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) ## 16CD12-BP8 (N) 165.7 set.seed(42) gahagan_ser1 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;ARSA&quot;) gahagan_ser2 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;BBURCG&quot;) gahagan_ser3 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;BBWRCG&quot;) ord1 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser1) ord2 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser2) ord3 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser3) # Suggested orderings rbind(ord1, ord2, ord3) ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 41CE19-F134 (S) 16RR1-BP3 (S) 16CD12-BP5 (N) ## ord1 5 1 4 7 ## ord2 5 1 4 3 ## ord3 5 1 4 7 ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) 41CE19-F119 (S) 16CD12-BP2 (N) 16CD12-BP8 (N) ## ord1 3 2 6 8 ## ord2 7 2 6 8 ## ord3 3 2 6 8 Crit &lt;- c(&quot;AR_events&quot;, &quot;AR_deviations&quot;, &quot;Gradient_raw&quot;, &quot;Gradient_weighted&quot;) gahagan_ord1 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord1) gahagan_ord2 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord2) gahagan_ord3 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord3) gahagan_dec_ord &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, dec_ord) gahagan_ca_ord &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ca_ord) # Comparison between original and ordered: Results &lt;- list(Original=gahagan_dist, Ordered1=gahagan_ord1, Ordered2=gahagan_ord2, Ordered3=gahagan_ord3, CA=gahagan_ca_ord, DEC=gahagan_dec_ord) round(sapply(Results, criterion, method=Crit), 1) ## Original Ordered1 Ordered2 Ordered3 CA ## AR_events 44.0 19.0 17.0 19.0 49.0 ## AR_deviations 1709.3 217.0 228.4 217.0 2335.2 ## Gradient_raw 24.0 74.0 78.0 74.0 14.0 ## Gradient_weighted 1227.1 3990.6 3956.5 3990.6 253.6 ## DEC ## AR_events 32.0 ## AR_deviations 584.1 ## Gradient_raw 48.0 ## Gradient_weighted 3176.5 battleship.plot(gahagan_pct[ord1, ], col=&quot;gray&quot;, cex.labels = .75) Since there are only eight contexts, it is feasible to consider all possible orderings to see if the preceding analysis found the best ordering. With 8 rows, there are 40,320 permutations, but half of these are reversals so we only need to consider the first 20,160 permutations. This takes a few minutes but it allows us to get the best ordering for each criterion. In this case the two best orderings are the same two that the seriation function provided. library(e1071) ## Registered S3 methods overwritten by &#39;proxy&#39;: ## method from ## print.registry_field registry ## print.registry_entry registry library(seriation) rows &lt;- nrow(gahagan_pct) perm &lt;- permutations(rows) nperm &lt;- factorial(rows) / 2 all_perms &lt;- t(sapply(seq(nperm), function(i) criterion(gahagan_dist, perm[i,], method=Crit))) # Permutations which minimize AR (first two) or maximize Gradient (second two) measures: # Permutation with mimimum AR events: which.min(all_perms[, 1]) ## [1] 2034 # Permutation with mimimum AR deviations: which.min(all_perms[, 2]) ## [1] 2634 # Permutation with maximum Gradient raw score: which.max(all_perms[, 3]) ## [1] 2034 # Permutation with maximum Gradient weighted score: which.max(all_perms[, 4]) ## [1] 2634 # Best order for event/raw count: perm[2034, ] ## [1] 5 1 4 3 7 2 6 8 # Best order for deviation/weighted score: perm[2634, ] ## [1] 5 1 4 7 3 2 6 8 # Quantiles for all measures: # AR events (lower is better): quantile(all_perms[, 1], probs=c(0, .01, .25, .50, .75, .99, 1)) ## 0% 1% 25% 50% 75% 99% 100% ## 17 32 49 57 63 76 84 # AR deviations (lower is better): round(quantile(all_perms[, 2], probs=c(0, .01, .25, .50, .75, .99, 1))) ## 0% 1% 25% 50% 75% 99% 100% ## 217 729 1875 2423 3040 3823 4261 # Gradient raw score (higher is better): quantile(all_perms[, 3], probs=c(0, .01, .25, .50, .75, .99, 1)) ## 0% 1% 25% 50% 75% 99% 100% ## -56 -40 -14 -2 14 48 78 # Gradient weighted score (higher is better): round(quantile(all_perms[, 4], probs=c(0, .01, .25, .50, .75, .99, 1))) ## 0% 1% 25% 50% 75% 99% 100% ## -2986 -2271 -980 -38 867 2875 3991 battleship.plot(gahagan_pct[perm[2034, ], ], col=&quot;gray&quot;, cex.labels = .75) battleship.plot(gahagan_pct[perm[2634, ], ], col=&quot;gray&quot;, cex.labels = .75) # gahagan.dst &lt;- round(dist(gahagan_pct[perm[2034, ], ], method=&quot;manhattan&quot;, diag=TRUE, upper=TRUE), 1) # par(mar=c(0, 0, 0, 0)) # image(as.matrix(gahagan.dst), ylim=c(1.1, -0.1), asp=1, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;, yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, frame.plot=FALSE) # image(200 - as.matrix(gahagan.dst), ylim=c(1.1, -0.1), asp=1, xaxt=&quot;n&quot;, yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, frame.plot=FALSE) We can conclude that (5 1 4 [3 7] 2 6 8) and (5 1 4 [7 3] 2 6 8) are the best seriations for these data.

The three sites in the lower part of the left quadrat exhibit lower diversity and evenness, and each represents the earliest context at each site to include a Gahagan biface. Those sites in the upper right quadrat have higher diversity and evenness, and occur later than those in the lower left quadrat. 3.6 Diversity through time Research question: Does mortuary assemblage diversity increase through time? Hypothesis: Caddo mortuary assemblages associated with Gahagan bifaces increase in diversity subsequent to their initial use as mortuary offerings. This hypothesis is tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds site where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. # diversity library(RRPP) # mutate data to add temporal assignment temp &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(temporal = c(1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2), .after = region) # revised table of diagnostics knitr::kable(temp) %&gt;% kable_styling() %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, box_css = &quot;border: 0px;&quot;) context region temporal adult_male adult_female uid_adult total_adult juvenile_male juvenile_female uid_juvenile total_juvenile alba celt catahoula friley gahagan hayes harrell reed scallorn coles_creek hickory_engraved holly_fine_engraved kiam_incised ceramic_bottle ceramic_bowl lithics ceramics D1 H J 41CE19-F134 South 1 0 2 4 6 0 0 1 1 157 10 0 0 16 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 184 0 0.2614012 0.5344039 0.3854909 41CE19-F119 South 2 1 1 2 4 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 0 12 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 21 2 0.7040000 1.5169478 0.7795570 16RR1-BP2 South 2 2 2 0 4 0 1 0 1 31 14 0 0 16 8 2 16 19 0 1 1 1 1 2 106 3 0.8321110 1.9731801 0.7940661 16RR1-BP3 South 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1 89 3 0 0 15 0 0 0 11 0 0 1 0 1 0 118 1 0.4251389 0.8726411 0.4870303 16CD12-BP1 North 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 1 1 35 1 2 1 1 3 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 43 3 0.4583333 1.1523342 0.5004524 16CD12-BP2 North 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 13 0 0.5207101 0.8587409 0.7816597 16CD12-BP5 North 2 3 8 1 12 0 0 9 9 12 0 0 1 2 9 0 0 19 0 0 0 0 0 0 43 0 0.6803678 1.2745830 0.7919429 16CD12-BP8 North 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 6 2 0.7600000 1.6094379 0.8982444 # attributes for plots temp.D1 &lt;- temp$D1 temp.J &lt;- temp$J time &lt;- temp$temporal #diversity ## plot diversity ggplot(temp, aes(x = time, y = temp.D1)) + geom_point(aes(shape = factor(context))) + scale_shape_manual(values = c(0:5,15,17)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; # are data not normally distributed? shapiro.test(temp.D1) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: temp.D1 ## W = 0.955, p-value = 0.7613 ## plot distribution hist(temp.D1, col=&#39;steelblue&#39;) # MODEL: temp.D1 as a function of time temp.simpson &lt;- lm.rrpp(temp.D1 ~ time, data = temp, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999) ## ANOVA: increase in diversity through time? anova(temp.simpson) ## ## Analysis of Variance, using Residual Randomization ## Permutation procedure: Randomization of null model residuals ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## Estimation method: Ordinary Least Squares ## Sums of Squares and Cross-products: Type I ## Effect sizes (Z) based on F distributions ## ## Df SS MS Rsq F Z Pr(&gt;F) ## time 1 0.189385 0.189385 0.71408 14.985 2.3179 0.00605 ** ## Residuals 6 0.075829 0.012638 0.28592 ## Total 7 0.265214 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Call: lm.rrpp(f1 = temp.D1 ~ time, iter = 9999, data = temp, print.progress = FALSE) 3.6.1 Evenness through time # evenness ## plot evenness ggplot(temp, aes(x = time, y = temp.J)) + geom_point(aes(shape = factor(context))) + scale_shape_manual(values = c(0:5,15,17)) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; # are data not normally distributed? shapiro.test(temp.J) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: temp.J ## W = 0.84242, p-value = 0.07976 ## plot distribution hist(temp.J, col=&#39;steelblue&#39;) # MODEL: J as a function of initial v. later contexts temporal.J &lt;- anosim(temp.J, grouping = time, permutations = 10000) ## ANOSIM: do temporal contexts differ by J? summary(temporal.J) ## ## Call: ## anosim(x = temp.J, grouping = time, permutations = 10000) ## Dissimilarity: bray ## ## ANOSIM statistic R: 1 ## Significance: 0.015598 ## ## Permutation: free ## Number of permutations: 10000 ## ## Upper quantiles of permutations (null model): ## 90% 95% 97.5% 99% ## 0.221 0.303 0.436 1.000 ## ## Dissimilarity ranks between and within classes: ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% N ## Between 14 17.50 21.0 24.50 28 15 ## 1 7 9.50 12.0 12.50 13 3 ## 2 1 3.25 5.5 8.75 11 10 "],["dgm---modeling-geometry.html", "Chapter 4 3DGM - Modeling Geometry 4.1 4078-8 4.2 4078-72", " Chapter 4 3DGM - Modeling Geometry Two Gahagan bifaces, both from the George C. Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum. Modeling was completed in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.4 [Build Number: 15]). In the previous studies (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), modeling occurred in advance of alignment, which used the auto3dgm package in R (Boyer et al. 2015; R Core Development Team, 2021). In this iteration, modeling still occurs first, followed by a novel method for assigning the front and back faces of each specimen. Details associated with that method are included in the next chapter. Following alignment, these specimens were landmarked using the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces. In both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in (Selden Jr. 2017).

The landmarking protocol developed for this project bears some visual similarities with the configuration used in the previous study (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), as well as other two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses (Buchanan and Collard 2010; Buchanan et al. 2011; Ragan and Buchanan 2018); however, it differs in some fundamental ways. The first and most obvious difference is that this is a three-dimensional study. The second is the method of landmark placement, where Geomagic Design X was used to generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks in a replicable manner using mathematically-defined criteria. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/figbev.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Gahagan biface 545 from the Gahagan Mound site, illustrating axial twisting. \\\\label{figbev}&quot; The goal of this effort was to increase the precision and rigour of the study by including the z-dimension to capture those morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting that are introduced through the practice of bifacial beveling. This landmarking protocol represents an intermediate iteration between the previous 2D analysis (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), and the forthcoming protocol that also includes semilandmarks placed on a series of equidistant cross-sections. The cross-sections increase the coverage of semilandmarks across the mesh topology, and provide for greater precision in the analysis of morphology for the whole object. The evolution of this landmarking protocol represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some landmarking protocols can beand often arerecycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration. 5.0.1 Generating the spline Unlike the previous study, where the outline of each Gahagan biface was projected onto a 2D plane, this effort enlists a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command, which is used to detect and extract 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network that is used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the biface. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at four mathematically-defined locations. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Spline extracted along the highest contours of the projectile. \\\\label{figspline}&quot; 5.0.2 Splitting the spline A few definitions are warranted before proceeding. Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Gahagan biface. The second and third splits (LM2 and LM3) occur at points of highest curvature, and LM2 is always split on the right side of the biface when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of auto3dgm, which is illustrated in Figure 7a of the manuscript. To place the final landmark (LM4), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM2 and LM3. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM4. 5.0.2.1 Spline split at location of LM1 The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the 2D sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The 3D spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). \\\\label{figlm1}&quot; 5.0.2.2 Spline split at locations of LM2 and LM3 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each biface where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output (see Figure 7a in the manuscript), and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM3 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. \\\\label{figsplinesplitlr}&quot; 5.0.2.3 Spline split at location of LM4 One additional landmark (LM4) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm4.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. \\\\label{figlm4}&quot; 5.0.2.4 Final spline Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into four discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of bifacial morphology that can be compartmentalised in the subsequent analyses (i.e., left/right [directional] asymmetry, blade/base morphological integration, etc.). The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Gahagan biface morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit-frbl.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Result of spline splits include four discrete splines, each articulating with a potential region of analytical interest. \\\\label{figsplinesplit-frbl}&quot; 5.0.3 Landmark and semilandmark placement Landmarks 1-4 were placed at the location of each spline split (blue points, below). Equidistant semilandmarks were then added to each of the four splines; 20 between LM1 and LM2, five between LM2 and LM4, five between LM4 and LM3, and 20 between LM3 and LM1. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lmslm-all.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;3D spline with landmarks (blue) and equidistant semilandmarks (white) applied, with top, right, and front planes. Semilandmarks are renumbered in post. \\\\label{figlmslm-all}&quot; Superficially, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks appears similar to those used in recent 2D studies. However, the rigourous protocol used in the application of landmarks and semilandmarks aids in capturing morphological variation that articulates with axial twisting introduced by knappers through the practice of beveling. Thus, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks provides for greater precision in the geometric morphometric analysis, marking a substantive advancement in those analytical protocols used to achieve a more complete and holistic analysis of Gahagan biface morphology. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/figbevlm.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Mesh for Gahagan biface 545 from Gahagan Mound with landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks applied. \\\\label{figbevlm}&quot; References "],["dgm---individual-vs.-cache.html", "Chapter 6 3DGM - Individual vs. Cache 6.1 Load packages + data 6.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis 6.3 Boxplot 6.4 Principal Components Analysis 6.5 Procrustes ANOVA 6.6 Modularity 6.7 Morphological integration 6.8 Morphological disparity 6.9 Mean shapes", " Chapter 6 3DGM - Individual vs. Cache This 3D geometric morphometric analysis follows recent analyses of Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), where Gahagan bifaces were found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, this volume). The analysis, and the two that precede it, builds upon the work of Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly. Research question: Does Gahagan biface morphology differ by burial context? Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as part of a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference. 6.1 Load packages + data # check for update devtools::install_github(&quot;geomorphR/geomorph&quot;, ref = &quot;Stable&quot;) ## Skipping install of &#39;geomorph&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (98166098) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation devtools::install_github(&quot;mlcollyer/RRPP&quot;) ## Skipping install of &#39;RRPP&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (96cab18f) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation # load libraries library(here) library(geomorph) ## Loading required package: rgl ## ## Attaching package: &#39;rgl&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:plotrix&#39;: ## ## mtext3d ## Loading required package: Matrix ## ## Attaching package: &#39;Matrix&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:reshape&#39;: ## ## expand ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:tidyr&#39;: ## ## expand, pack, unpack library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./data&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdata.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]], rownames(qdata)),] 6.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.2 (R Core Development Team, 2021) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.1 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021).

The analysis, and the two that precede it, builds upon the work of Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly. Research question: Does Gahagan biface morphology change through time as mortuary assemblage diversity increases? Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through timeinitial vs. subsequent depositionas mortuary assemblage diversity increases. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased. The analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time: Initial Individual: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Initial Cache: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature Subsequent Individual: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Subsequent Cache: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature 7.1 Load packages + data # load libraries library(here) library(geomorph) library(tidyr) library(ggplot2) library(wesanderson) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./data&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdata.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]], rownames(qdata)),] qdata &lt;- qdata %&gt;% unite(&quot;merged&quot;, t.context:context, remove = FALSE) 7.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.2 (R Core Development Team, 2021) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.1 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).

Pick better value with `binwidth`. 7.4 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). # principal components analysis pca &lt;- gm.prcomp(Y.gpa$coords) summary(pca) ##

Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by context (context), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M.
