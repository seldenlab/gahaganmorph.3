  Gahagan bifaces differ in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles and Perdiz arrow points, and also between the Caddo and central Texas regions. This study asks whether Gahagan biface morphology differs between stratigraphically-defined---and chronologically discrete---burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on qualitative differences in Caddo burial practices. Results indicate a significant difference in size between burial contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, where the pattern is inverted. At both sites, biface shape remains consistent and does not differ among contexts, indicating an established `shape preference` in the northern and southern behavioral regions that may have shifted significantly in size due to cyclical differences in the variable social mechanisms associated with raw material procurement. Gahagan bifaces also differ in shape between Caddo burial contexts where a biface was placed _alongside an individual_ and those found as part of a cache placed _alongside the northern wall of the burial feature_. Each burial tradition articulates with a distinct `community of practice` relating to Gahagan biface `placement` and `design intent`.

# Introduction

Found to occur along the western margin of the American Southeast, Gahagan bifaces are among the most recognizable and well known components of Caddo material culture, and were regularly included with burial offerings during the Formative (CE 800-1000) and Early (CE 1000-1250) Caddo periods \citep{RN7115,RN8189,RN5746,RN8186,RN8174,RN8176}. Recent efforts to characterize general trends associated with Gahagan biface morphology yielded support for a `spatial boundary` that divides the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions based upon morphological differences that occur in Caddo bottles, Gahagan bifaces, and Perdiz arrow points (Figure 1c) \citep{RN7925,RN8071,RN8361,RN8967,RN11064,RN8154}. A second `shape boundary` has also been posited based upon differences in Gahagan biface morphology between the Caddo and central Texas regions \citep{RN8318}.

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1

**Gahagan bifaces selected for inclusion in Caddo burials differ in morphology through time.**

Hypothesis 1 is tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing temporal positions. There is an important cultural distinction between archaeological contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, in that all of the Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation were recovered in association with an individual (Burials 1, 2, 5, and 8) \citep{RN8174}, and all of the Gahagan bifaces from George C. Davis articulate with caches included along the northern periphery of two group burials (Features 119 and 134) \citep{RN5746,RN8186}. The information gathered from the analysis provides valuable insights with regard to changes in aesthetic preference, as well as design intent for Gahagan bifaces recovered from discrete temporal intervals.

### Hypothesis 2

**Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual.**

Hypothesis 2 is tested using Gahagan bifaces from two discrete Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential `design intent`.

# Contexts of recovery

All Gahagan bifaces used in the analysis were recovered from Caddo burial contexts, and were excavated between 1912 and 1969. Stratigraphic contexts were used to delimit temporal contexts---although the span of that temporal difference remains unclear---and figures were redrafted from the original works that illustrate clear stratigraphic differences. Additional contextual information was used to identify Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside an individual, or in caches along the northern wall of the burial pit. Specific references are made to published images and illustrations that depict these burial contexts during excavation. While no images or illustrations of burial contexts were included here, those are included with the supplemental materials \citep{RN11065}.

## Gahagan Mound
Gahagan bifaces were identified in 1911 in Deposits 1, 2, and 3 of Burial Pit 1 at the Gahagan Mound site in northwest Louisiana by \citet[Figures 18-19, 21]{RN7115}. A subsequent excavation at the Gahagan Mound site in 1936 identified two additional burial features containing Gahagan bifaces (Burial Pits 2 and 3) (Figure 2) \citep[Plate 27]{RN8176}, and the entirety of the Gahagan Mound site was eventually destroyed by the meander of the Red River between four and five years later \citep{RN10759}.

# Methods

Data collection procedures are outlined by \cite{RN8154} and \cite{RN8318}. The characteristic points and tangents used in the landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of \cite{RN5700}, and the landmarking protocol is discussed in detail in the [supplementary materials](https://seldenlab.github.io/gahaganmorph.3/). 

Landmarks were aligned to a global coordinate system \citep{RN8102,RN8587,RN8384}, achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition \citep{RN8525}, performed in R 4.1.1 \citep{RN8584} using the `geomorph` package v4.0.1 \citep{RN8565,RN9565} (Figure 4). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data allowing for comparisons among objects \citep{RN5698,RN8525}. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space \citep{RN8511,RN8384}.

Principal components analysis \cite{RN8576,RN10875} was used to visualize shape variation among the bifaces (Fig. 5). The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of the landmarks or the reference 3D mesh \cite{RN8555,RN8553}. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs \cite{RN8579,RN8334}, which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present \cite{RN6995}. To assess whether shape differs by context, Procrustes ANOVAs \cite{RN7046} were run that enlist effect-sizes (z-scores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions \cite{RN8477}.

A comparison of mean consensus configurations was used to characterize shape variation in Gahagan bifaces recovered from contexts where they were found atop or beside an individual or as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial pit.

# Results 

## Hypothesis 1a

In assessing a temporal change in preference between Gahagan bifaces from Mound 5 at the Mounds Plantation site, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial Pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1, cutting downward from the mound’s surface \citep{RN8174}. The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that this burial occurred after those associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8 \citep{RN8174}.

A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test whether a significant difference exists in Gahagan biface shape by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.1211; Pr(>F) = 0.2224), followed by a second to assess differences in Gahagan biface (centroid) size by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.49514; Pr(>F) = 0.0059).

## Hypothesis 1b

To assess the temporal change in preference between caches of Gahagan bifaces recovered from Mound C at the George C. Davis site, those from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119 \citep{RN5746,RN8186}. The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred subsequent to those associated with Feature 134 \citep{RN5746,RN8186}.

A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test whether a significant difference exists in Gahagan biface shape by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.04604; Pr(>F) = 0.3061), followed by a second to assess differences in Gahagan biface (centroid) size by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.14787; Pr(>F) = 0.0599).

## Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis 2 is tested using two broad categories of Gahagan bifaces; one interred as part of a _cache_, and the other placed atop or alongside _individuals_. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential `design intent`.

A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test whether a significant difference exists in Gahagan biface shape by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.21033; Pr(>F) = 1e-04), followed by a second to assess differences in Gahagan biface (centroid) size by context (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.01138; Pr(>F) = 0.3933).

## Summary

Temporal differences in Gahagan bifaces articulate with size rather than shape at the Mounds Plantation site, and no differences in shape or size were found to occur in Gahagan bifaces recovered from F119 and F134 at the George C. Davis site. A significant difference in the shape of Gahagan bifaces occurs between those bifaces recovered from _cache_ and _individual_ contexts.

The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components \citep{RN8312,RN8313,RN8299}, which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology \citep{RN8207,RN8965,RN8154,RN8318,RN9364}, and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results \citep{RN10760}. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress \citep{RN10761}.
