This study asks whether assemblage diversityfor mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifaceschanges through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on this difference in context. A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes to Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts at each site express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between the Caddo burial traditions, articulating with different communities of practice relating to assemblage diversity, placement and shape preference. These findings comprise the basis for our discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a Caddo burial tradition that included Gahagan bifaces. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered atop or alongside an individual denoted by black dot. Additional information for each biface, including the option to download full-resolution 2D images of individual bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Shape preference as a function of burial practice Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete Caddo burial contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference. 0.2.1.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts do not differ in size The size of Gahagan bifaces from individual contexts occupies a significantly greater range of morphospace than those from caches, indicating greater diversity in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/mshape-cache-ind.jpg&#39;) (#fig:h2.box)There is a significant difference Gahagan biface shapes from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of contexts, cache is presented in gray, and individual in black. 0.2.1.2 Summary of results This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces that articulate with two distinct Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference. Results demonstrate a significant difference in shapebut not sizefor Gahagan bifaces included with Caddo burials. Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where six Gahagan bifaces were buried atop or alongside an individual, and the remainder were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating both to the placement of the bifaces, and the design (shape) of those Gahagan bifaces interred in each context. Temporally, Caddo burials with Gahagan bifaces in the northern behavioral region occur later than contexts in the southern behavioral region. Thus, it is likely that both burial practices originated in the southern behavioral region evidenced by individuals interred at Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis with Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside them. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioral region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

Additional thanks to the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, the Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science for providing access to the Gahagan bifaces. RZS expresses his gratitude to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments and constructive criticisms on the analyses of Gahagan biface morphology. We wish to thank Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms of the landmarking protocol used in this study (LM3d1), as well as the landmarking protocol for Gahagan bifaces that will be used in subsequent analytical efforts (LM3d2); to Martin Hinz for fielding questions related to the oxcAAR package, to Derek Hamilton for his guidance with the chronological models; and to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Lauren Butaric, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).
