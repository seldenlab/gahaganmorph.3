This study asks whether assemblage diversity and evennessfor mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifacesincreases through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on context. A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes in Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between Caddo burial traditions, indicating discrete communities of practice related to both object placement and shape preference. These findings comprise the basis for a discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of the Caddo burial practice that included Gahagan bifaces. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered atop or alongside an individual denoted by black dot.

This hypothesis is tested using counts of attributes and associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mounds site where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assesses whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/abundance.png&#39;) Figure 0.1: Relative abundance of a, adults and juveniles (binned to encompass all age categories from sub-adult to fetus); b, lithic and ceramic artifacts; and c, diagnostic artefact types recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts that included a Gahagan biface. Contexts ordered temporally from bottom to top based on results of seriation (see Chapter 2). The middle two contexts (16RR1-BP2 and 16CD12-BP5) are interchangeable. 0.2.1.1 Findings: Juveniles were not included in the three latest assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces Lithics comprise 75% or morein three cases, 100%of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include a significantly greater diversity of associated diagnostics Caddo mortuary contexts that occur following initial deposition include significantly greater evenness across the types knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/diversity2-1.png&#39;) (#fig:diversity.out)Caddo burial assemblages that include Gahagan bifaces; 1, 41CE19-F134; 2, 41CE19-F119; 3, 16RR1-BP2; 4, 16RR1-BP3; 5, 16CD12-BP1; 6, 16CD12-BP2; 7, 16CD12-BP5; 8, 16CD12-BP8. The three sites in the lower part of the left quadrat exhibit lower diversity and evenness, and each represents the earliest context at each site to include a Gahagan biface. Those sites in the upper right quadrat have higher diversity and evenness, and occur later than those in the lower left quadrat. 0.2.1.2 Summary of results The hypothesis was tested using counts of associated diagnostic artefacts recovered from Caddo mortuary contexts at the Mounds Plantation, George C. Davis, and Gahagan Mound sites where Gahagan bifaces were included as part of the mortuary assemblage. The hypothesis assessed whether diagnostic material culture objects included with Caddo burials became more diverse and evenly distributed among the types as burial practices evolved. This follows with an expected increase in assemblage diversity during the cultural and subsistence-based transition from mobile horticulture to emergentand more sedentaryagricultural communities. Results demonstrate that lithics comprise 75% or morein three cases, 100%of those Caddo burial assemblages where Gahagan bifaces were recovered, as well as a significant increase in the diversity and evenness of diagnostic artefacts included in Caddo burial contexts with Gahagan bifaces. This general trend articulates with the development, maintenance, and evolution associated with a Caddo burial practice. These assemblages are dominated by lithic diagnostics, and ceramics are absent from three of the burial contexts. Further discussion related to diagnostic types that do/do not transcend specific spatial and temporal boundaries are included in the manuscript. 0.2.2 Shape preference as a function of burial practice Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces from individual and cache contexts differ through time as assemblage diversity increases. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased. The analysis employs four discrete categories to assess morphological changes through time: Initial Individual: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Initial Cache: from initial burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature Subsequent Individual: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred atop or alongside an individual Subsequent Cache: from subsequent burial contexts that included Gahagan bifaces at each site, and interred as part of a cache along the northern wall of the burial feature 0.2.2.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Subsequent Cache and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from Initial Cache and Initial Individual contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Cache contexts differ significantly in size Gahagan bifaces from Initial Individual and Subsequent Individual contexts differ significantly in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/comp.composite.jpg&#39;) (#fig:h2.box)In the comparison of Gahagan bifaces from discrete burial contexts, gray dots represent the mean shape at the top of the column, and black dots represent the mean shape at right. All comparisons in the first column differ significantly in size, those in the second column differ significantly in shape, and those in the third column do not differ in shape or size. 0.2.2.2 Summary of results This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from four discrete contexts; the first interred with an individual in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the second interred as part of a cache in the earliest (initial) burial context at each site, the third interred with an individual in subsequent burial contexts, and the fourth interred as a cache in subsequent burial contexts. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference as the diversity of Caddo mortuary assemblages increased. Results demonstrate a significant difference in shape or size through time for all but one context (caches), which is potentially representative of design intent. Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where six Gahagan bifaces were buried atop or alongside an individual, and the remainder were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating both to the placement of the bifaces, and the design (shape) of those Gahagan bifaces interred in each context. The temporal component is delimited by the same initial and subsequent contexts used in the analysis of assemblage diversity. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioral region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction.

Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).
