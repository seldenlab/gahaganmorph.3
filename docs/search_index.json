Carlson3 2021-12-14 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry Contextual differences in Caddo burials that included Gahagan bifaces indicate two discrete burial traditions; one where a biface was placed atop or alongside an individual and another where a cache of Gahagan bifaces was placed alongside the northern wall of the burial feature. This study asks whether assemblage diversityfor mortuary contexts associated with Gahagan bifaceschanges through time, and whether Gahagan biface morphology may differ based on this difference in context. A seriation of mortuary contexts paired with an analysis of mortuary assemblage diversity highlights changes to Caddo burial assemblages through time, where the earliest contexts at each site express lower diversity and evenness than later contexts. Results also indicate that Gahagan biface morphology differs between the Caddo burial traditions, articulating with different communities of practice relating to assemblage diversity, placement and shape preference. These findings comprise the basis for our discussion of the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of a Caddo burial tradition that included Gahagan bifaces. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered atop or alongside an individual denoted by black dot. Additional information for each biface, including the option to download full-resolution 2D images of individual bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Shape preference as a function of burial practice Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete Caddo burial contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference. 0.2.1.1 Findings: Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts do not differ in size The size of Gahagan bifaces from individual contexts occupies a significantly greater range of morphospace than those from caches, indicating greater diversity in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/mshape-cache-ind.jpg&#39;) (#fig:h2.box)There is a significant difference Gahagan biface shapes from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of contexts, cache is presented in gray, and individual in black. 0.2.1.2 Summary of results This hypothesis was tested using Gahagan bifaces that articulate with two distinct Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential shape preference. Results demonstrate a significant difference in shapebut not sizefor Gahagan bifaces included with Caddo burials. Contextual differences suggest two distinct Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where six Gahagan bifaces were buried atop or alongside an individual, and the remainder were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating both to the placement of the bifaces, and the design (shape) of those Gahagan bifaces interred in each context. Temporally, Caddo burials with Gahagan bifaces in the northern behavioral region occur later than contexts in the southern behavioral region. Thus, it is likely that both burial practices originated in the southern behavioral region evidenced by individuals interred at Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis with Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside them. That there are no cache offerings of Gahagan bifaces associated with the northern behavioral region raises questions regarding whether the spatial boundary may have been permeable, but in only one direction. Acknowledgments RZS extends his gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the Caddo Nation Tribal Council, Tribal Chairman, and Tribal Historic Preservation Office for their guidance related to the development of the 3D scanning protocols and permission for access to NAGPRA and previously repatriated collections. Additional thanks to the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, the Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science for providing access to the Gahagan bifaces. RZS expresses his gratitude to Harry J. Shafer, Hiram F. (Pete) Gregory, Christian S. Hoggard, and David K. Thulman for their comments and constructive criticisms on the analyses of Gahagan biface morphology. We wish to thank Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms of the landmarking protocol used in this study (LM3d1), as well as the landmarking protocol for Gahagan bifaces that will be used in subsequent analytical efforts (LM3d2); to Martin Hinz for fielding questions related to the oxcAAR package, to Derek Hamilton for his guidance with the chronological models; and to Dean C. Adams, Michael L. Collyer, Emma Sherratt, Lauren Butaric, and Kersten Bergstrom for their constructive criticisms, general comments, and suggestions throughout the development of this research program. Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Gahagan bifaces at the Williamson Museum at Northwestern State University, Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural Science was provided to the RZS by the Heritage Research Center at Stephen F. Austin State University. Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Selden Jr et al. 2021), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).

Robinson developed the method of seriation by permuting distance matrices. He used a similarity matrix where 200 was the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent decreases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The seriation package implements this as a manhattan distance matrix where 0 is the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent increases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The AR measure (Anti-Robinson) counts the number of times there is a decrease between adjacent values. The AR_deviation measure weights the index by the difference in values. These are loss measures meaning that low values are better. The Gradient_raw and Gradient_weighted indices are similar, but look at triplets. These are merit measures meaning that higher values are better. There are other options, but these are relatively straightforward. The seriation package has multiple methods for seriating distance matrices. The ARSA (Anti-Robinson seriation by simulated annealing) method attempts to minimize the linear seriation criterion defined by Robinson. Two other methods use branch and bound algorithms (BBURCG and BBWRCG) focus on the gradient measures. The five ordinations are then compared to the original order of the data. The detrended correspondence ordering is better than the correspondence ordering, but the permutation orderings are better. The ARSA and BBWRCG oderings are the same and the BBURCG ordering differs only by the switching of the positions of 16RR1-BP2 (S) and 16CD12-BP5 (N). The first (and third) orderings have the best values for AR_deviations (lowest) and Gradient_weighted (highest) whereas the second ordering has the best values for AR_events (lowest) and Gradient_raw (highest). The battleship plot shows the first ordering. library(seriation) gahagan_dist &lt;- dist(gahagan_pct, method=&quot;manhattan&quot;) # Distance matrix: round(gahagan_dist, 1) ## 41CE19-F134 (S) 41CE19-F119 (S) 16RR1-BP2 (S) 16RR1-BP3 (S) ## 41CE19-F119 (S) 127.2 ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) 113.8 90.9 ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) 28.0 124.6 92.7 ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 38.0 134.8 117.7 40.0 ## 16CD12-BP2 (N) 166.1 71.6 140.6 159.4 ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) 133.8 138.5 85.3 116.4 ## 16CD12-BP8 (N) 182.6 157.6 146.3 154.8 ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 16CD12-BP2 (N) 16CD12-BP5 (N) ## 41CE19-F119 (S) ## 16RR1-BP2 (S) ## 16RR1-BP3 (S) ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) ## 16CD12-BP2 (N) 167.2 ## 16CD12-BP5 (N) 122.4 133.5 ## 16CD12-BP8 (N) 178.3 175.0 165.7 set.seed(42) gahagan_ser1 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;ARSA&quot;) gahagan_ser2 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;BBURCG&quot;) gahagan_ser3 &lt;- seriate(gahagan_dist, method=&quot;BBWRCG&quot;) ord1 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser1) ord2 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser2) ord3 &lt;- get_order(gahagan_ser3) # Suggested orderings rbind(ord1, ord2, ord3) ## 16CD12-BP1 (N) 41CE19-F134 (S) 16RR1-BP3 (S) 16CD12-BP5 (N) 16RR1-BP2 (S) ## ord1 5 1 4 7 3 ## ord2 5 1 4 3 7 ## ord3 5 1 4 7 3 ## 41CE19-F119 (S) 16CD12-BP2 (N) 16CD12-BP8 (N) ## ord1 2 6 8 ## ord2 2 6 8 ## ord3 2 6 8 Crit &lt;- c(&quot;AR_events&quot;, &quot;AR_deviations&quot;, &quot;Gradient_raw&quot;, &quot;Gradient_weighted&quot;) gahagan_ord1 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord1) gahagan_ord2 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord2) gahagan_ord3 &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ord3) gahagan_dec_ord &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, dec_ord) gahagan_ca_ord &lt;- permute(gahagan_dist, ca_ord) # Comparison between original and ordered: Results &lt;- list(Original=gahagan_dist, Ordered1=gahagan_ord1, Ordered2=gahagan_ord2, Ordered3=gahagan_ord3, CA=gahagan_ca_ord, DEC=gahagan_dec_ord) round(sapply(Results, criterion, method=Crit), 1) ## Original Ordered1 Ordered2 Ordered3 CA DEC ## AR_events 44.0 19.0 17.0 19.0 49.0 32.0 ## AR_deviations 1709.3 217.0 228.4 217.0 2335.2 584.1 ## Gradient_raw 24.0 74.0 78.0 74.0 14.0 48.0 ## Gradient_weighted 1227.1 3990.6 3956.5 3990.6 253.6 3176.5 battleship.plot(gahagan_pct[ord1, ], col=&quot;gray&quot;, cex.labels = .75) Since there are only eight contexts, it is feasible to consider all possible orderings to see if the preceding analysis found the best ordering.

The brackets indicate the only difference between the two. However, given the relatively small sample sizes, it may be that sampling fluctuations could make other orderings better. Running the North and South groups separately produces the same orderings (although South is reversed).

"],["dgm---modeling-geometry.html", "Chapter 4 3DGM - Modeling Geometry 4.1 4078-8 4.2 4078-72", " Chapter 4 3DGM - Modeling Geometry Two Gahagan bifaces, both from the George C. Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum. Modeling was completed in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.4 [Build Number: 15]). In the previous studies Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied (2020), modeling occurred in advance of alignment, which used the auto3dgm package in R R Core Development Team, (2021). In this iteration, modeling still occurs first, followed by a novel method for assigning the front and back faces of each specimen. Details associated with that method are included in the next chapter. Following alignment, these specimens were landmarked using the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces. In both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in (Selden Jr. 2017). The images that follow include a before and after modeling image of each biface, illustrating the area of the biface that was missing, and the subsequent model that was used in the geometric morphometric analysis. In the case of 4078-8, a single semilandmark was included in the modeled area. No semilandmarks were placed in the modeled area of 4078-72. 4.1 4078-8 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-8-unmodeled.png&#39;) Figure 4.1: Gahagan biface 4078-8, before modeling. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-8-modeled.png&#39;) Figure 4.2: Gahagan biface 4078-8, after modeling. 4.2 4078-72 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-72-unmodeled.png&#39;) Figure 4.3: Gahagan biface 4078-72, before modeling. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-72-modeled.png&#39;) Figure 4.4: Gahagan biface 4078-72, after modeling. References "],["dgm---landmarking-protocol.html", "Chapter 5 3DGM - Landmarking Protocol", " Chapter 5 3DGM - Landmarking Protocol The landmarking protocol used for this study (LM3d1) is identical to that used by Selden and colleagues (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020); which is appended below, and available at: https://github.com/aksel-blaise/gahaganmorph2/blob/master/analysis/landmarking-protocol.md. The landmarking protocol developed for this project bears some visual similarities with the configuration used in the previous study (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), as well as other two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses (Buchanan and Collard 2010; Buchanan et al. 2011; Ragan and Buchanan 2018); however, it differs in some fundamental ways. The first and most obvious difference is that this is a three-dimensional study. The second is the method of landmark placement, where Geomagic Design X was used to generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks in a replicable manner using mathematically-defined criteria. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/figbev.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Gahagan biface 545 from the Gahagan Mound site, illustrating axial twisting. \\\\label{figbev}&quot; The goal of this effort was to increase the precision and rigour of the study by including the z-dimension to capture those morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting that are introduced through the practice of bifacial beveling. This landmarking protocol represents an intermediate iteration between the previous 2D analysis (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018), and the forthcoming protocol that also includes semilandmarks placed on a series of equidistant cross-sections. The cross-sections increase the coverage of semilandmarks across the mesh topology, and provide for greater precision in the analysis of morphology for the whole object. The evolution of this landmarking protocol represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some landmarking protocols can beand often arerecycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration. 5.0.1 Generating the spline Unlike the previous study, where the outline of each Gahagan biface was projected onto a 2D plane, this effort enlists a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command, which is used to detect and extract 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network that is used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the biface. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at four mathematically-defined locations. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Spline extracted along the highest contours of the projectile. \\\\label{figspline}&quot; 5.0.2 Splitting the spline A few definitions are warranted before proceeding. Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Gahagan biface. The second and third splits (LM2 and LM3) occur at points of highest curvature, and LM2 is always split on the right side of the biface when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of auto3dgm, which is illustrated in Figure 7a of the manuscript. To place the final landmark (LM4), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM2 and LM3. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM4. 5.0.2.1 Spline split at location of LM1 The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the 2D sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The 3D spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). \\\\label{figlm1}&quot; 5.0.2.2 Spline split at locations of LM2 and LM3 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each biface where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output (see Figure 7a in the manuscript), and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM3 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. \\\\label{figsplinesplitlr}&quot; 5.0.2.3 Spline split at location of LM4 One additional landmark (LM4) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm4.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. \\\\label{figlm4}&quot; 5.0.2.4 Final spline Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into four discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of bifacial morphology that can be compartmentalised in the subsequent analyses (i.e., left/right [directional] asymmetry, blade/base morphological integration, etc.). The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Gahagan biface morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit-frbl.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Result of spline splits include four discrete splines, each articulating with a potential region of analytical interest. \\\\label{figsplinesplit-frbl}&quot; 5.0.3 Landmark and semilandmark placement Landmarks 1-4 were placed at the location of each spline split (blue points, below). Equidistant semilandmarks were then added to each of the four splines; 20 between LM1 and LM2, five between LM2 and LM4, five between LM4 and LM3, and 20 between LM3 and LM1. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lmslm-all.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;3D spline with landmarks (blue) and equidistant semilandmarks (white) applied, with top, right, and front planes. Semilandmarks are renumbered in post. \\\\label{figlmslm-all}&quot; Superficially, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks appears similar to those used in recent 2D studies. However, the rigourous protocol used in the application of landmarks and semilandmarks aids in capturing morphological variation that articulates with axial twisting introduced by knappers through the practice of beveling. Thus, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks provides for greater precision in the geometric morphometric analysis, marking a substantive advancement in those analytical protocols used to achieve a more complete and holistic analysis of Gahagan biface morphology. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/figbevlm.png&#39;) fig.cap=&quot;Mesh for Gahagan biface 545 from Gahagan Mound with landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks applied. \\\\label{figbevlm}&quot; References "],["dgm---analysis.html", "Chapter 6 3DGM - Analysis 6.1 Load packages + data 6.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis 6.3 Boxplot 6.4 Principal Components Analysis 6.5 Procrustes ANOVA 6.6 Morphological disparity 6.7 Mean shapes", " Chapter 6 3DGM - Analysis This 3D geometric morphometric analysis follows recent analyses of Gahagan biface morphology across the southern Caddo area and central Texas (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), where Gahagan bifaces were found to differ in shape across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, this volume). The analysis, and the two that precede it, builds upon the work of Shafer (1973, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly. Hypothesis: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. This hypothesis is tested using Gahagan bifaces recovered from two discrete contexts; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential shape preference. 6.1 Load packages + data # load libraries library(here) library(geomorph) library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./data&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdata.csv&quot;,header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]], rownames(qdata)),] 6.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.0 (R Core Development Team, 2021) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.0 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).
