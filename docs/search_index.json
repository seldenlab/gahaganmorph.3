Selden, Jr.1 and John E. Dockall2 2021-10-09 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry Gahagan bifaces represent one of three categories of Caddo material culture that express significant differences in morphology across the same geography as Caddo bottles (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and Perdiz arrow points (Selden and Dockall, in review). Gahagan biface morphology was also found to differ significantly between the ancestral Caddo area and central Texas regions (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). That Gahagan bifaces differ across two spatial boundaries was noteworthy, particularly since they are assumed to have been manufactured in central Texas, arriving in the ancestral Caddo area as products of trade or exchange (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020; Shafer 1973a, 1974, 2006). Gahagan bifaces express significant morphological differences when recovered from the areas of the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions, which suggested that the temporal range of the shape boundary might extend to the Formative/Early Caddo period (CE 800 - 1250); a notion that was supported by previous analyses of Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019), and later confirmed in a more comprehensive analysis of Caddo bottles (Selden Jr. 2021). This effort is the first to shift the analytical foci of this research program from one of regional trends to one of local Caddo burial contexts. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/fig02.jpg&#39;) (#fig:gahagan bifaces 2D)Gahagan bifaces from the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions. Bifaces recovered atop or alongside an individual denoted by black dot. Additional information for each biface, including the option to download full-resolution 2D images of individual bifaces, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-gahaganbiface/. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Temporal change in Caddo preference Hypothesis 1: Gahagan bifaces selected for inclusion in Caddo burials differ in morphology through time. Hypothesis 1 is tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing temporal positions. There is an important cultural distinction between archaeological contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, in that all of the Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation were recovered in association with an individual (Burials 1, 2, 5, and 8) (Webb and McKinney 1975), and all of the Gahagan bifaces from George C. Davis articulate with caches included along the northern periphery of two group burials (Features 119 and 134) (Shafer 1973a; Story 1997). The information gathered from the analysis provides valuable insights with regard to changes in aesthetic preference, as well as design intent for Gahagan bifaces recovered from discrete temporal intervals. 0.2.1.1 Hypothesis 1a: Temporal change in Caddo preference at Mounds Plantation In assessing a temporal change in preference between Gahagan bifaces from Mound 5 at the Mounds Plantation site, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial Pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1, cutting downward from the mounds surface (Webb and McKinney 1975). The stratigraphic position of Burial Pit 2 indicates that this burial occurred after those associated with Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8 (Webb and McKinney 1975). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1a.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.1: Stratigraphic position of Burial Pits 1 and 2 at the Mounds Plantation site; adapted from Webb (1975:Figure 7). Burial Pit 2 is the only burial found to be intrusive from the mound surface. 0.2.1.1.1 Hypothesis 1a Findings: Gahagan bifaces from BPs 1, 5, and 8 contexts do not differ in shape from BP2 contexts Gahagan bifaces from BPs 1, 5, and 8 contexts differ significantly in size from BP2 contexts BP2 (later) bifaces are significantly smaller than the earlier bifaces from BPs 1, 5, and 8 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/mp-size.png&#39;) (#fig:h1a.box)Difference in centroid size between Gahagan bifaces from earlier (BPs 1, 5, and 8) and later (BP 2) contexts at the Mounds Plantation site. 0.2.1.2 Hypothesis 1b: Temporal change in Caddo preference at George C. Davis To assess the temporal change in preference between caches of Gahagan bifaces recovered from Mound C at the George C. Davis site, those from Feature 134 are contrasted with those from Feature 119 (Shafer 1973a; Story 1997). The stratigraphic position of Feature 119 indicates that the burials in that feature occurred subsequent to those associated with Feature 134 (Shafer 1973a; Story 1997). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/h1b.jpg&#39;) Figure 0.2: Stratigraphic position of Features 119 and 134 at the George C. Davis site; adapted from Story (1997:Figure 13). 0.2.1.2.1 Hypothesis 1b Findings: Gahagan bifaces from F134 and F119 do not differ in shape Gahagan bifaces from F134 and F119 differ significantly in size F119 (later) bifaces are significantly larger than the earlier bifaces from F134 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gcd-size.png&#39;) (#fig:h1b.box)Difference in centroid size between Gahagan bifaces from earlier (F134) and later (F119) contexts at the George C. Davis site. 0.2.1.3 Hypothesis 1: Summary of results Hypothesis 1 was tested using two samples of Gahagan bifaces from Caddo burial contexts at the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites where stratigraphy dictates differing (earlier/later) temporal positions. There is an important cultural distinction between archaeological contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, in that all of the Gahagan bifaces from Mounds Plantation were recovered in association with an individual (Burials 1, 2, 5, and 8) (Webb and McKinney 1975), and all but one of the Gahagan bifaces from George C. Davis articulate with caches included along the northern periphery of two group burials (Features 119 and 134) (Shafer 1973a; Story 1997). Previous studies have demonstrated a significant difference in shape between Gahagan bifaces recovered from the Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis sites (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018). The results presented here demonstrate no significant intrasite differences in shape, but do support an inverse relationship in size between bifaces found in earlier and later contexts at Mounds Plantation and George C. Davis, where Gahagan bifaces were found to be significantly smaller in the later contexts at Mounds Plantation, and significantly larger in the later contexts at George C. Davis. 0.2.2 Differential design intent of Gahagan bifaces Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. Hypothesis 2 is tested using Gahagan bifaces from two discrete Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential design intent. 0.2.2.1 Hypothesis 2 Findings: Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts differ significantly in shape Gahagan bifaces from cache and individual contexts do not differ in size knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/mshape-cache-ind.jpg&#39;) (#fig:h2.box)There is a significant difference Gahagan biface shapes from cache and individual contexts. In the comparison of contexts, cache is presented in gray, and individual in black. 0.2.2.2 Hypothesis 2: Summary of results Hypothesis 2 was tested using Gahagan bifaces that articulate with two distinct Caddo burial practices; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Burial practices may have been constrained by local morphological requirements, highlighting aspects of differential design intent. Results highlight a significant difference in shapebut not sizefor Gahagan bifaces included with Caddo burials. Contextual differences suggest two Caddo burial traditions associated with Gahagan bifaces; one more prevalent in the northern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were placed atop or alongside an individual, and one more prevalent in the southern behavioral region where Gahagan bifaces were included as a cache offering along the northern periphery of the burial. Each burial tradition appears to have been bounded by its own community of practice relating to both the placement of the bifaces, and the design (shape) of the Gahagan bifaces used in each context. While the northern community of practice appears to have been in operation at the same time as that of the southern community of practice, evidenced by individuals buried at Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis with Gahagan bifaces placed atop or alongside them, the inverse is not currently supported by the archaeological record. This raises questions regarding whether the northern burial tradition predates that of the south, or whether the spatial boundary was permeable, but in only one direction.

Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce the analytical findings are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018).

Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were missing small sections of the blade along the lateral edge. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US), ensuring that modeling was kept to a minimum. Modeling was completed in Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.4 [Build Number: 15]). In the previous studies Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied (2020), modeling occurred in advance of alignment, which used the auto3dgm package in R R Core Development Team, (2021). In this iteration, modeling still occurs first, followed by a novel method for assigning the front and back faces of each specimen. Details associated with that method are included in the next chapter. Following alignment, these specimens were landmarked using the same landmarking protocol as the unmodeled bifaces. In both cases, the area of highest concern was that of the lateral edge. To ensure that the fit followed the existing contour, the area was first cut and cleaned, then bridges were constructed that enlisted variable curvature, following the existing curvature of the edge. Once fitted with the bridge, the remaining holes on either side were filled following those protocols set forth in (Selden Jr. 2017). The images that follow include a before and after modeling image of each biface, illustrating the area of the biface that was missing, and the subsequent model that was used in the geometric morphometric analysis. In the case of 4078-8, a single semilandmark was included in the modeled area. No semilandmarks were placed in the modeled area of 4078-72. 2.1 4078-8 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-8-unmodeled.png&#39;) Figure 2.1: Gahagan biface 4078-8, before modeling. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-8-modeled.png&#39;) Figure 2.2: Gahagan biface 4078-8, after modeling. 2.2 4078-72 knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-72-unmodeled.png&#39;) Figure 2.3: Gahagan biface 4078-72, before modeling. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/41ce19-4078-72-modeled.png&#39;) Figure 2.4: Gahagan biface 4078-72, after modeling.

Hypothesis 1a: Temporal change in Caddo preference at Mounds Plantation In assessing a temporal change in preference between Gahagan bifaces from Mound 5 at the Mounds Plantation site, those from burials included during mound development and/or construction (Burial Pits 1, 5, and 8) are contrasted with those from Burial Pit 2 which cuts into the corner of Burial Pit 1, cutting downward from the mounds surface (Webb and McKinney 1975).

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).

Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by context (context), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (M.

The analysis builds upon previous discussions and analyses conducted by Shafer (1973b, 1974, 2006). A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly. Hypothesis 2: Gahagan bifaces included in Caddo burials as a cache differ in morphology from those placed atop or alongside an individual. Hypothesis 2 is tested using two broad categories of Gahagan bifaces; one interred as part of a cache, and the other placed atop or alongside individuals. Distinct Caddo burial practices may have constrained local morphological requirements, highlighting differential design intent. 6.1 Load packages + data # load libraries library(here) library(geomorph) library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./dataH2&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdataH2.csv&quot;,header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]], rownames(qdata)),] 6.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.1.0 (R Core Development Team, 2021) using the geomorph library v. 4.0.0 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).
